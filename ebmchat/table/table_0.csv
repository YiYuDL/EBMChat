A meta-analysis of second-line treatments for HCC has been performed to better tailor their use based on improved patient stratification and to identify the best available option. METHODS: Pubmed, Scopus, Web of Science, and ClinicalTrials.gov were searched for randomized controlled trials evaluating second-line treatment for advanced HCC in patients already treated with sorafenib. The primary outcome was overall survival (OS). Secondary outcomes were progression-free survival (PFS) and drug withdrawal due to adverse events. Network meta-analyses were performed considering placebo as the basis for comparison in efficacy and safety analyses. Subgroup stratification considered gender, age, sorafenib-responsiveness and drug tolerability, viral infection, macrovascular invasion, HCC extrahepatic spread, performance status, and alpha-fetoprotein levels. RESULTS: Fourteen phase II or III randomized controlled trials, involving 5,488 patients and 12 regimens, were included in the analysis. Regorafenib (hazard ratio (HR) = 0.63, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.50-0.79), cabozantinib (HR = 0.76, 95% CI = 0.63-0.92), and ramucirumab (HR = 0.82, 95% CI = 0.70-0.76) significantly prolonged OS compared with placebo. Cabozantinib (HR = 0.44, 95% CI = 0.36-0.52), regorafenib (HR = 0.46, 95% CI = 0.37-0.56), ramucirumab (HR = 0.54, 95% CI = 0.43-0.68), brivanib (HR = 0.56, 95% CI = 0.42-0.76), S-1 (HR = 0.60, 95% CI = 0.46-0.77), axitinib (HR = 0.62, 95% CI = 0.44-0.87), and pembrolizumab (HR = 0.72, 95% CI = 0.57-0.90) significantly improved PFS compared with placebo. None of the compared drugs deemed undoubtedly superior after having performed a patients' stratification. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this network meta-analysis suggest the use of regorafenib and cabozantinib as second-line treatments in HCC.",0.6944079748257236

To summarize the evidence supporting the systemic treatment of Chinese patients with advanced HCC, we performed a systematic review using a literature search of PubMed, Embase, China National Knowledge Infrastructure, and the Chinese Scientific Journal Database between 1 January 2009 and 15 June 2021, and abstracts from ASCO 2020, ASCO GI 2021, ESMO 2020, and ESMO GI 2020. The inclusion criteria were: Chinese patients aged >/=18 years with advanced HCC; first- or second-line systemic therapy; an evaluation of the efficacy or safety outcomes; and a randomized controlled, non-randomized controlled, prospective, or retrospective design. Thirty reports were identified for the following therapies: the single-agent tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI; n = 10), single-agent programmed death-1 (PD-1) inhibitor (n = 4), chemotherapy (n = 5), PD-1/programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) inhibitor plus TKI (n = 6), PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitor plus bevacizumab or biosimilar (n = 4), and PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitor plus chemotherapy (n = 1). The heterogeneity between the studies precluded statistical analysis and the data were summarized using tables. In the first-line setting, evidence supported the use of atezolizumab or sintilimab plus bevacizumab or a biosimilar.

METHODS: ASCO convened an Expert Panel to update the 2020 guideline on systemic therapy for HCC. The panel updated the systematic review to include randomized controlled trials (RCTs) published through October 2023 and updated recommendations. RESULTS: Ten new RCTs met the inclusion criteria and were added to the evidence base. RECOMMENDATIONS: Atezolizumab + bevacizumab (atezo + bev) or durvalumab + tremelimumab (durva + treme) may be offered first-line for patients with advanced HCC, Child-Pugh class A liver disease, and Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status 0-1. Where there are contraindications to these therapies, sorafenib, lenvatinib, or durvalumab may be offered first-line. Following first-line treatment with atezo + bev, second-line therapy with a tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI), ramucirumab (for patients with alpha-fetoprotein [AFP] >/=400 ng/mL), durva + treme, or nivolumab + ipilimumab (nivo + ipi) may be recommended for appropriate candidates. Following first-line therapy with durva + treme, second-line therapy with a TKI is recommended. Following first-line treatment with sorafenib or lenvatinib, second-line therapy options include cabozantinib, regorafenib for patients who previously tolerated sorafenib, ramucirumab (AFP >/=400 ng/mL), nivo + ipi, or durvalumab; atezo + bev or durva + treme may be considered for patients who did not have access to these therapies in the first-line setting, and do not have contraindications. Pembrolizumab or nivolumab are also options for appropriate patients following sorafenib or lenvatinib. Third-line therapy may be considered in Child-Pugh class A patients with good PS, using one of the agents listed previously that has a nonidentical mechanism of action with previously received therapy. A cautious approach to systemic therapy is recommended for patients with Child-Pugh class B advanced HCC. Further guidance on choosing between options is included within the guideline.Additional information is available at www.asco.org/gastrointestinal-cancer-guidelines.",0.6693500137079123

This study aimed to identify the most beneficial regimen. METHODS: A systematic search was conducted from July 2012 to August 2024 across the following four databases: PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, and ClinicalTrials.gov. This search focused on phase III prospective randomized controlled trials that compared first-line treatment for advanced hepatocellular carcinoma. RESULTS: Seventeen studies involving 10322 patients were included in this network meta-analysis. Of the studies we included, twelve studies were global multicenter clinical studies, four were initiated in China, and one was initiated in Korea. The results of our statistical analysis suggest that Hepatic artery infusion chemotherapy with oxaliplatin plus fluorouracil (HAIC-FO) demonstrated significant overall survival (OS) benefits compared with most treatments, including various immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) and anti-vascular endothelial growth factor tyrosine kinase inhibitors (VEGF-TKIs). In terms of OS, HAIC had shown similar efficacy with sorafenib plus FOLFOX (HR, 0.88; 95% CI: 0.37-2.09) and transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE) combined with lenvatinib (HR, 0.69; 95% CI: 0.30-1.56). Notably, immune-related treatments, such as ICIs combined with anti-VEGF therapies, also showed improved OS compared with anti-VEGF-TKIs alone. In terms of progression-free survival (PFS), HAIC-FO outperformed anti-VEGF-TKI monotherapy, ICI monotherapy, and several ICI combinations. However, it was not superior to lenvatinib plus TACE or lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab. Based on the Surface Under the Cumulative Ranking Curve (SUCRA) values, HAIC-FO was ranked the most effective in terms of OS (SUCRA = 0.961) and objective response rate (ORR) (SUCRA = 0.971). The results of the subgroup analysis suggested that HAIC-FO achieved the best OS benefit in the macrovascular invasion (MVI) and extrahepatic spread (EHS) subgroup (SUCRA = 0.99) and that tremelimumab combined with durvalumab achieved the best OS benefit in the Asian subgroup (SUCRA = 0.88). CONCLUSION: This systematic review and network meta-analysis suggest that HAIC-based therapies may become a potential first-line treatment option for advanced HCC, especially for patients in Mainland China with MVI and EHS. Additionally, immune-related treatments may be more suitable for Asian populations.",0.666489825780593

However, most treatment modalities lack head-to-head comparisons, and the distinctions in their efficacy and safety have yet to be elucidated. Consequently, the accurate selection of a treatment regimen poses a significant challenge for clinicians. METHODS: This study incorporated twenty-three randomized controlled trials, encompassing fifteen first-line and eight second-line treatments, and involving a total of 14,703 patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma. Results: In the context of first-line treatment, it was observed that the combination of a PD-1 inhibitor with bevacizumab (1/15) significantly extended overall survival in patients with advanced HCC. Furthermore, PD-1 inhibitors combined with TKIs (1/15) and PD-1 inhibitors combined with bevacizumab (2/15) exhibited enhanced efficacy in reducing the risk of progression-free survival events. In second-line therapy, the network meta-analysis revealed that all investigational agents prolonged progression-free survival in patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma when compared to placebo. Cabozantinib ranked first (1/7) in this regard. However, this translated into an overall survival benefit only for cabozantinib, regorafenib, ramucirumab, and pembrolizumab, with regorafenib achieving the highest ranking (1/7). CONCLUSION: In the treatment of advanced HCC, the immune checkpoint inhibitor combined with bevacizumab regimen and the immune checkpoint inhibitor combined with TKI regimen stand out as the two most effective first-line treatment options. It is noteworthy that, for patients with absolute contraindications to VEGF inhibitors, dual immunotherapy is the preferred choice. For second-line treatment, regorafenib and cabozantinib are identified as the two most effective options.

We compared and ranked all relevant transarterial and targeted treatments competing with atezolizumab+bevacizumab for such disease, based on direct and indirect evidence. This network meta-analysis was conducted as a systematic review of phase 2 and 3 randomized sorafenib-controlled trials investigating systemic treatment strategies for HCCs unsuitable for or that progressed after surgery or locoregional treatments as first-line option published between 2008 and 2021. We ranked the treatments based on overall survival (OS) as the primary outcome, together with progression-free survival (PFS) and grade 3-4 adverse events. Subgroup analyses were also implemented to estimate intervention efficacies in particular groups. We identified 3451 publications, 15 trials consisting of 7158 patients, using 14 different therapies including combinations of sorafenib with transarterial chemoembolization (TACE), hepatic arterial chemoinfusion, and radioembolization. Regarding OS, atezolizumab+bevacizumab was the only regimen significantly superior to sorafenib (hazard ratio 0.42; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.25-0.70), and it ranked first. This combination was also the best in the PFS analysis (0.59; 0.47-0.74), followed by lenvatinib (0.66; 0.57-0.76) and TACE+sorafenib (0.73; 0.59-0.91); all had significantly better outcomes than sorafenib alone. TACE+sorafenib (0.52; 0.27-1.00) was ranked first based on OS in a subset with portal invasion, but not in the metastatic series, with atezolizumab+bevacizumab second (0.58; 0.38-0.89). Lenvatinib (odds ratio 1.76; 95% CI 1.35-2.30) and TACE+sorafenib (2.02; 1.23-3.32), but not atezolizumab+bevacizumab (1.38; 0.93-2.05), were significantly less safe than sorafenib monotherapy. Conclusion: Our results indicate that atezolizumab+bevacizumab is the best first-line clinically relevant systemic modality in advanced HCC.

Although the guidelines recommend first-line treatments such as sorafenib, lenvatinib, and atezolizumab in combination with bevacizumab (T+A) and second-line treatments such as regorafenib, the efficacy comparison between drugs is lacking, that is, a treatment is not recommended as the optimal or alternative choice for a specific patient population. Therefore, we will conduct a high-quality network meta-analysis based on Phase III randomized controlled trials (RCTs) to systematically evaluate and compare overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS), objective response rate (ORR), and serious adverse events (SAE) of different treatment protocols in the context of first-line and second-line therapies, which are critical for clinical decision making and prognostic improvement in advanced HCC patients. METHODS: The studies of interest were Phase III RCTs evaluating the efficacy or safety of first- or second-line therapies in patients with unresectable or advanced HCC. Literature published in English from the four databases of PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, and Web of Science was comprehensively searched from the inception to May 23, 2022. Outcomes of interest included OS, PFS, ORR, and SAE. A league table was developed to show the results of the comparison between different treatments. A histogram of cumulative probability was drawn to discuss the ranking probability of treatments based on different outcomes. The effectiveness and safety of various treatments were comprehensively considered and the two-dimensional diagram was plotted to guide clinical practice. The Gemtc package in R Studio was used for network meta-analysis in a Bayesian framework. RESULTS: The results showed that HAIC-FO was superior to T+A regimen, regardless of OS, PFS or ORR. TACE combined with lenvatinib performed better than T+A in PFS, and ORR. In addition to the T+A regimen, Sintilimab combined with IBI305 and camrelizumab combined with apatinib were also associated with longer OS, PFS, and ORR, and their SAE incidence was not higher than that of T+A, especially for camrelizumab combined with apatinib, its safety was better than that of T+A regimen. There were no new treatments or combinations that were more effective than regorafenib. It was important to note that for PFS, the efficacy of apatinib and cabozantinib was not statistically different from that of regorafenib, so these two treatments could be used as alternative treatment options in cases where regorafenib was not tolerated or treatment failed. CONCLUSIONS: We conducted a network meta-analysis to evaluate the efficacy and safety of multiple treatment modalities by integrating the results of direct and indirect comparisons. This study included high-quality multicenter Phase III RCTs, collated and summarized all treatments involved in advanced or unresectable HCC in first-line and second-line settings, and compared with T+A and regorafenib, respectively, and ranked based on efficacy and safety to support clinical decision making.",0.6284100706467247

However, due to rapid publication of new studies that attained their predefined primary end points, a lack of robust cross-trial comparison of first-line therapies, and diverging clinical guidelines, no clear-cut treatment flowchart and sequence of therapies are available. This critical analysis of the recommendations for the management of advanced HCC from the main scientific societies in the US and Europe adopted an integrated approach to provide information on the clinical benefit (overall survival and progression-free survival) and safety profile of these therapies using the European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO)-Magnitude of Clinical Benefit Scale (MCBS) score and an ad hoc network meta-analysis. OBSERVATIONS: There is a major consensus among guidelines that atezolizumab plus bevacizumab has a primacy as the recommended first-line treatment of choice in advanced HCC. On progression after immunotherapy-containing regimens and for patients with contraindications for immunotherapies, most guidelines maintain the established treatment hierarchy, recommending lenvatinib or sorafenib as the preferred options, followed by either regorafenib, cabozantinib, or ramucirumab. Thus far, the first-line immune-based regimen of tremelimumab plus durvalumab has been integrated only in the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases guidance document and the latest National Comprehensive Cancer Network guidelines and has particular utility for patients with a high risk of gastrointestinal bleeding. Overall, in the first-line setting, both atezolizumab plus bevacizumab and sintilimab plus IBI305 (a bevacizumab biosimilar) and durvalumab plus tremelimumab received the highest ESMO-MCBS score of 5, indicating a substantial magnitude of clinical benefit. In a network meta-analysis, no significant differences in overall survival were found among the various combination regimens. However, the newly reported combination of camrelizumab plus rivoceranib was associated with a significantly higher risk of treatment-related adverse events compared with atezolizumab plus bevacizumab (relative risk, 1.59; 95% CI, 1.25-2.03; P < .001). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: This narrative review found that atezolizumab plus bevacizumab is regarded as the primary standard of care for advanced HCC in the first-line setting. These findings from integrating the recommendations from scientific societies' guidelines for managing advanced HCC along with new data from cross-trial comparisons may aid clinicians in decision-making and guide them through a rapidly evolving and complex treatment landscape.",0.6249276754550928

AAT + ICIs demonstrated a significant benefit in median OS (mOS), median PFS (mPFS), and ORR (20.5 [95% CI 17.5-24] months, 7.5 [95% CI 6.5-8.8] months, and 24% [95% CI 17%-30%], respectively). ICIs + ICIs and ICI monotherapy ranked second and third, respectively with an mOS of 20 (95% CI 18.5-21.5) months and 14.5 (95% CI 13.5-16) months, respectively. The OS, PFS, and ORR of patients treated with AAT, AAT + targeted therapy, and AAT + chemotherapy were similar to those of patients treated with sorafenib. A higher proportion of patients with Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) stage C had a shorter OS. OS was associated with publication year, and PFS was associated with the proportion of patients with BCLC stage C. The incidence of grade >/= 3 adverse events in the ICIs and ICIs + ICIs treatment groups was low. CONCLUSIONS: The study results provide valuable information from which to base rational clinical drug use and serves as a reliable external control for evaluating new treatments for aHCC.",0.6248779706863482

Clinically, the major unmet needs are recurrence after curative-intent surgery, liver transplantation or local ablation and disease progression in those with hepatocellular carcinoma not eligible for resection or failed locoregional therapy. In the recent few years, new targeted therapy and immune-checkpoint inhibitors have been registered as systemic therapy to address these issues. Notably, new forms of systemic therapy, either as first-line or second-line therapy for unresectable hepatocellular or those not eligible for locoregional therapy, are now available. New data is also emerging with the use of systemic therapy to prevent hepatocellular carcinoma recurrence after curative-intent resection or local ablation therapy and to retard disease progression after locoregional therapy. In the future, further implementation of immune-checkpoint inhibitors and other forms of immunotherapy are expected to bring a new paradigm to the management of hepatocellular carcinoma. New insight related to immune-related adverse events with the use of immunotherapy has allso enabled optimization of the therapeutic approach to patients with hepatocellular carcinoma. The purpose of this clinical practice guideline is to provide an up-to-date recommendation based on clinical evidence and experience from expert Asia-Pacific key opinion leaders in the field of hepatocellular carcinoma. Three key questions will be addressed, namely: (1) Which patients with hepatocellular carcinoma should be considered for systemic therapy? (2) Which systemic therapy should be used?

METHODS: In this open-label, phase III trial, patients with advanced HCC, previously untreated with systemic therapy, were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive HAIC-FO or sorafenib. The primary end point was overall survival (OS) in the intention-to-treat population. An exploratory model for predicting the efficacy of HAIC-FO on the basis of genomic sequencing was developed. RESULTS: Between May 2017 and May 2020, 262 patients were randomly assigned. The median tumor size was 11.2 cm (interquartile range, 8.5-13.7 cm). Macrovascular invasion was present in 65.6%, and the percentage of patients with > 50% tumor volume involvement of the liver and/or Vp-4 portal vein tumor thrombosis was 49.2%. At data cutoff (October 31, 2020), median OS was 13.9 months for HAIC-FO and 8.2 for sorafenib (hazard ratio [HR] 0.408; 95% CI, 0.301 to 0.552; P < .001).

HAIC-based treatment showed great potential for treating uHCC. However, large-scale studies on HAIC-based treatments and meta-analyses of first-line treatments for uHCC are lacking. AIM: To investigate better first-line treatment options for uHCC and to assess the safety and efficacy of HAIC combined with angiogenesis inhibitors, programmed cell death of protein 1 (PD-1) and its ligand (PD-L1) blockers (triple therapy) under real-world conditions. METHODS: Several electronic databases were searched to identify eligible randomized controlled trials for this meta-analysis. Study-level pooled analyses of hazard ratios (HRs) and odds ratios (ORs) were performed. This was a retrospective single-center study involving 442 patients with uHCC who received triple therapy or angiogenesis inhibitors plus PD-1/PD-L1 blockades (AIPB) at Sun Yat-sen University Cancer Center from January 2018 to April 2023. Propensity score matching (PSM) was performed to balance the bias between the groups. The Kaplan-Meier method and cox regression were used to analyse the survival data, and the log-rank test was used to compare the suvival time between the groups.

Hepatic arterial infusion chemotherapy (HAIC) has been suggested for patients with HCC and major PVTT. Purpose To compare the efficacy and safety of sorafenib plus 3cir-OFF HAIC versus sorafenib alone for advanced HCC with major PVTT. Materials and Methods This phase II trial recruited systemic treatment-naive patients with HCC and major PVTT (portal vein invasion grade Vp3 [first branch] and Vp4 [main trunk]) between June 2017 and November 2019. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1 ratio) to receive sorafenib (400 mg twice daily) plus 3cir-OFF HAIC (35 mg/m(2) oxaliplatin [hours 0-2] followed by 600 mg/m(2) 5-fluorouracil [hours 2-24], days 1-3) with a standardized percutaneous port catheter system or sorafenib alone (400 mg twice daily) every 4 weeks. The primary end point was overall survival (OS). The secondary end points were objective response rate, progression-free survival (PFS), and safety. OS and PFS were assessed using the Kaplan-Meier method and log-rank test. Results The intent-to-treat population included 64 patients, with 32 in each group. The median OS was 16.3 months (95% CI: 0.0, 35.5) with sorafenib plus HAIC and 6.5 months (95% CI: 4.4, 8.6) with sorafenib alone (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.28; 95% CI: 0.15, 0.53; P < .001). A higher objective response rate (41% [n = 13] vs 3% [n = 1], P < .001) and a longer median PFS (9.0 months vs 2.5 months; HR = 0.26; 95% CI: 0.15, 0.47; P < .001) were observed in the sorafenib plus HAIC group.

There is still no global consensus or standard guidelines on the management of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) with PVTT. Increasing evidence suggests that more aggressive treatment modalities, including transarterial chemoembolization, radiotherapy, targeted therapy, and various combination therapies, may improve the prognosis and prolong the survival of advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (aHCC) patients with PVTT. We aim to comprehensively review and compare the efficacy and safety of these advanced options for aHCC with PVTT. METHODS: A comprehensive literature search was conducted on PubMed and EMBASE for phase II or III randomized controlled trials (RCTs) investigating multimodality treatments for aHCC with PVTT. Kaplan-Meier curves for overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival were constructed to retrieve individual patient-level data to strengthen the comparison of the benefits of all multimodality treatments of interest. Each study was pooled in a fixed-effects network meta-analysis (NMA). We also conducted subgroup analyses using risk ratios extracted from each study, including viral etiology, Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) staging, alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) levels, macrovascular invasion or portal vein tumor thrombosis, and extrahepatic spread. Multimodality treatments were ranked using SUCRA scores. RESULTS: We identified 15 randomized controlled trials with 16 multimodality regimens that met the inclusion criteria. Among them, 5,236 patients with OS results and 5,160 patients with PFS results were included in the analysis. The hepatic arterial infusion chemotherapy of fluorouracil, leucovorin, and oxaliplatin (HAIC-FO) showed OS and PFS benefits over all the other therapies. In terms of OS, HAIC-FO, nivolumab, and TACE+Len were superior to sorafenib, lenvatinib, and donatinib monotherapies, as well as HAIC-FO+Sor. In terms of PFS, TACE+Len showed better benefits than lenvatinib, donatinib, and tremelimumab+durvalumab. A low heterogeneity (I (2) < 50%) and consistency were observed. The SUCRA score for OS ranked HAIC-FO+sorafenib as the best treatment option among all multimodality treatments in hepatitis B, MVI, or PVTT with EHS and AFP 400 mug/L subgroups. CONCLUSION: HAIC-FO and HAIC-FO+sorafenib are statistically better options for unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma with PVTT among the multimodality treatments, and their effective and safe implementation may provide the best outcomes for HCC-PVTT patients.",0.6042179342047452

The primary outcome was overall survival (OS) and the secondary outcome was progression free survival (PFS). RESULTS: A total of 29 RCTs encompassing 18,229 patients were included. In first-line trials. Atezolizumab + bevacizumab (atezo-bev) (P-score, 87 %) and STRIDE (P-score, 75 %) yielded the best OS benefits among all approved regimens in the HBV population; atezo-bev (P-score, 94 %) ranked the best in HCV patients. For non-viral aetiology, STRIDE (P-score, 79 %) ranked the best whereas atezo-bev (P-score, 29 %) ranked the worst. Pairwise MA showed that ICI + VEGF/VEGFRi has significantly different HR compared to control (sorafenib) in different etiology (HBV: 0.65, HCV: 0.72, and non-viral: 0.98, p = 0.01), while ICI has consistent HR compared to control irrespective of disease etiology (HBV: 0.81, HCV: 0.79, non-viral: 0.83, p = 0.94). CONCLUSION: Treatment efficacy of advanced HCC is affected by underlying liver disease. The survival benefit of ICI + VEGF/VEGFRi was mainly seen in viral-HCC.",0.5996684146577537

However, inconsistent results have been reported in various studies assessing different combinations of targeted agents. METHODS: A network meta-analysis (NMA) was performed by including 23 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) with 6175 patients to investigate the efficiency of transarterial therapies in combination with different TKIs. Outcomes of interest included overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS), time to progression (TTP), and tumor objective response rate (ORR). A random-effects consistency model was used in this Bayesian NMA. Hazard ratio and odd risks with a 95% credible interval were calculated and agents were ranked based on ranking probability. RESULTS: HAIC showed maximal OS and TTP and TACE plus lenvatinib showed maximal PFS, ORR, and disease control rate (DCR). HAIC and TACE plus lenvatinib were ranked highest based on their respective parameters, which were OS for HAIC and PFS, ORR, and DCR for TACE plus lenvatinib. CONCLUSION: HAIC and TACE plus lenvatinib were relatively better choice for unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma. However, owing to the lack of statistically significant OS benefits among most agents, other agents should be considered as potential alternatives for unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma.",0.5949072304271086

Despite proven benefits of combined regimens, optimal sequencing remains unclear. This network meta-analysis evaluates safety and efficacy of therapeutic sequences in intermediate-advanced HCC. METHODS: We conducted a comprehensive search of multiple databases, including PubMed, Cochrane Library, Web of Science, and EMBASE, for studies published until February 1, 2025. Cochrane's tools and the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale were used to assess the evaluation of bias. We performed data compilation and conducted a network meta-analysis to compare the relative efficacy of different treatments. RESULTS: A total of 56 studies (10,456 patients) evaluated 11 therapeutic sequences. Survival outcomes favored TACE-AADs-ICIs (TAI), which ranked highest for overall survival (OS: SUCRA 90.0%) and progression-free survival (PFS: SUCRA 91.3%). Tumor responses differed significantly across regimens: TACE-ICIs (TI) achieved the highest probability of complete response rate (CRR: SUCRA 83.9%), while AADs-ICIs-TACE (AIT) ranked first in objective response rate (ORR: SUCRA 85.8%). Notably, ICIs-AADs (IA) achieved superior disease control rate (DCR: SUCRA 88.1%). ICIs monotherapy (I) was associated with the lowest incidence of grade >/= 3 adverse events (AEs: SUCRA 11.7%). CONCLUSION: Our comprehensive network meta-analysis establishes a multidimensional efficacy-safety profile for sequential therapies in intermediate and advanced HCC management. TACE-initiated sequences (TAI/TIA) optimize survival (OS/PFS: SUCRA > 90%), while systemic-first regimens (AIT/IA) maximize tumor response (ORR/DCR: SUCRA > 85%). ICIs monotherapy exhibits the safest profile. Further clinical studies are warranted to determine optimal treatment sequencing for intermediate and advanced HCC.",0.5933883038259968

PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors plus antiangiogenic drugs (PIAD) as a new therapeutic approach for advanced HCC is still a subject of clinical debate regarding whether they offer improved treatment outcomes. This study was conducted to compare the two treatments in terms of antitumor efficacy and safety. METHODS: Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing PIAD and sorafenib for advanced HCC were retrieved from six databases. Survival (overall survival [OS] and progression-free survival [PFS]) were the main outcomes measured. Secondary endpoints included responses, adverse events (AEs), and effects on quality of life. RESULTS: Seven studies based on four RCTs (CARES-310, COSMIC-312, IMbrave150, and ORIENT-32) were included. The PIAD group exhibited better OS (hazard ratio [HR]: 0.69, 95% confidence interval [CI]: [0.53, 0.89], P = 0.005), and PFS (HR: 0.60, 95% CI: [0.53, 0.67], P < 0.00001). The survival advantages of OS and PFS were confirmed in almost all subgroups. The PIAD group exhibited higher OS rates at 6-18 months and PFS rates at 6-12 months. Additionally, the objective response rate, disease control rate, complete response, and partial response were higher in PIAD group. The PIAD group had a delayed decline in quality of life, physical functioning, and role functioning. However, the PIAD group experienced more grades 3-5 and serious AEs, along with treatment discontinuation, dose reduction, and dose interruption. CONCLUSIONS: PIAD appears to be better than sorafenib for advanced HCC with better survival and responses. However, its higher rate of AEs requires cautious attention.",0.5923197133248785

Therefore, we aimed to compare clinical outcomes of LEN combined with transarterial chemoembolization (LEN-TACE) versus LEN monotherapy in patients with advanced HCC. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This was a multicenter, randomized, open-label, parallel group, phase III trial. Patients with primary treatment-naive or initial recurrent advanced HCC after surgery were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive LEN plus on-demand TACE (LEN-TACE) or LEN monotherapy. LEN was initiated within 3 days after random assignment (initial dose: 12 mg once daily for patients >/= 60 kg; 8 mg once daily for patients < 60 kg). TACE was initiated one day after LEN initiation. The primary end point was overall survival (OS). RESULTS: Between June 2019 and July 2021, a total of 338 patients underwent random assignment at 12 centers in China: 170 to LEN-TACE and 168 to LEN. At a prespecified event-driven interim analysis after a median follow-up of 17.0 months, the median OS was significantly longer in the LEN-TACE group (17.8 v 11.5 months; hazard ratio, 0.45; P < .001). The median progression-free survival was 10.6 months in the LEN-TACE group and 6.4 months in the LEN group (hazard ratio, 0.43; P < .001). Patients in the LEN-TACE group had a higher objective response rate according to the modified RECIST (54.1% v 25.0%, P < .001). Multivariable analysis revealed that portal vein tumor thrombus and treatment allocation were independent risk factors for OS. CONCLUSION: The addition of TACE to LEN improves clinical outcomes and is a potential first-line treatment for patients with advanced HCC.",0.5913479116590511

We aimed to assess the efficacy, safety, and cost-effectiveness of immunotherapy or targeted therapy as the first-line strategy for unresectable HCC. METHODS: The included clinical trials were retrieved from PubMed, Embase, the Cochrane library, and Web of Science databases, in which immunotherapy or targeted therapy was regarded as the first-line treatment for unresectable HCC, published in English between January 1, 2010, and September 20, 2022. We conducted a network meta-analysis (NMA) and cost-effectiveness analysis (CEA) from the Chinese payer's perspective. Overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS), the ranks of different treatments using P-score, and adverse events (AEs) were evaluated by NMA. Total costs, life-years (LYs), quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), and incremental cost-benefit ratio (ICER) were estimated from 15-year Markov models developed by CEA. RESULTS: We identified 2,825 records, including 11,796 patients, from 15 RCTs. The NMA revealed that sintilimab plus a bevacizumab biosimilar (HR, 0.57; 95% CI, 0.43 to 0.75; P = 0.96) and camrelizumab plus rivoceranib (HR, 0.56; 95% CI, 0.41 to 0.66; P = 0.94) could lead to great improvements in OS and PFS compared with sorafenib-related survival. The CEA indicated that tislelizumab increased by 0.220 QALYs (0.312 LYs) and decreased by $1,938 compared with sorafenib, which yielded ICERs of -$8,809/QALY (-$2,612/LY).

However, the differences in effectiveness between these treatment protocols require further verification. To this end, this study employs a Bayesian network meta-analysis to compare the efficacy and safety of TACE, Lenvatinib, and PD-1/L1 inhibitors, whether administered by monotherapy or in combination, providing evidence-based medicine for the treatment of unresectable HCC. PURPOSE: This study employed a network meta-analysis to evaluate the efficacy and safety of trans-arterial chemoembolization (TACE), Programmed Cell Death Protein/Ligand 1 (PD-1/L1) inhibitors, and Lenvatinib in the treatment of advanced HCC. METHODS: Literature on the treatment of advanced HCC with TACE, PD-1/L1 inhibitors, and Lenvatinib was searched for in both Chinese and English databases, including PubMed, EMBASE, ClinicalTrials.gov, Cochrane Library, CNKI, and Wanfang. Two researchers conducted independent screening and data extraction, and the meta-analysis was performed using R language with the gemtc package. RESULTS: After retrieval and screening, a total of 21 articles were included, involving 2052 participants and six treatment modalities: Lenvatinib (L), TACE (T), TACE + Lenvatinib (TL), Lenvatinib + PD-1/L1 inhibitors (LP), TACE + Lenvatinib + PD-1/L1 inhibitors (TLP), and TACE + PD-1/L1 inhibitors (TP). In terms of objective response rate (ORR), the TLP regimen provided the optimal effect. In predicting the best ORR, TLP had the highest (75.5%) probability. In terms of disease control rate (DCR), the TLP regimen showed the best effect. In predicting the best DCR, the TLP again offered the highest (76.1%) probability. In terms of overall survival (OS), the best outcome was observed in the TLP protocol. In predicting the best OS, the TLP holds the highest (86.00%) probability. Furthermore, the best outcome in progression-free survival (PFS) was found in the TLP regimen. In predicting the best PFS, the TLP still holds the highest (97.0%) result. CONCLUSION: The combination of TACE, Lenvatinib, and PD-1/L1 inhibitors appears to provide the maximum benefit for inoperable HCC patients.",0.5740078853654836

Our previous studies suggested that TACE plus oral medication of thalidomide, carmofur and compound mylabris capsule (TCC cocktail) may be a better therapeutic option. METHODS: In this randomized, open-label, multicenter clinical trial, 72 treatment-naive HCC patients were randomly assigned to receive cTACE alone or cTACE plus oral TCC cocktail between July 2018 and October 2019. The primary endpoint of this trial was the 1-, 2- and 3-year overall survival (OS) rates. The second endpoints of this trial included 1-, 2- and 3-year progression-free survival (PFS) rates, objective response rates (ORR) according to the modified Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (mRECIST), and safety with adverse events (AEs). RESULTS: The 1-, 2- and 3-year OS rates were significantly higher in the cTACE plus TCC group than in the cTACE group (83.2% vs 54.3%, 63.1% vs 30.1%, 37.7% vs 18.1%; p = 0.008), with a significantly longer median OS (29.0 vs 15.0 months; p < 0.001). Regarding the 1-, 2- and 3-year PFS rates, HCC patients in the cTACE plus TCC group also demonstrated significantly higher rates (66.3% vs 34.4%, 35.8% vs 18.8%, 31.8% vs 15.6%; p = 0.014) and had a longer median PFS (16.0 vs 8.0 months; p < 0.001) compared with cTACE group.

Hepatic arterial infusion chemotherapy (HAIC), as a localized treatment modality, has demonstrated favorable therapeutic efficacy in patients with advanced HCC accompanied by portal vein tumor thrombus and extensive intrahepatic metastasis. In recent years, the combination of HAIC with immune and targeted therapy has gradually gained acceptance in East Asian countries. However, further investigation is necessary to assess the efficacy and safety of this triple therapy. METHOD: PubMed, Embase, the Cochrane Library, and Web of Science databases were systematically searched for studies conducted within the past 5 years on HAIC combined with immunotherapy and targeted therapy as first-line treatment for advanced HCC. According to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines, we conducted this meta-analysis. Additionally, the quality of included studies was assessed using the Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) scale. Outcomes such as overall response rate (ORR), disease control rate (DCR), progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), and adverse events (AEs)were extracted and pooled from eligible studies. RESULT: Twelve studies involving 1072 patients were enrolled in this meta-analysis. In terms of tumor response, the pooled ORR and DCR were 65.7% (95% CI, 58.7%-72.7%) (I(2) = 83%, P = 0.000) and 89.2% (95% CI, 83.9%-93.6%) (I(2) = 83%, P = 0.000), respectively. When analyzing PFS, the upper limit of 95% confidence interval of PFS in one study was not reached, which could potentially impact the statistical analysis. Therefore, we analyzed the remaining 11 studies a total of 1019 patients to pool mPFS, ultimately the pooled mPFS was 9.77months (95% CI, 7.73-11.80) (I(2) = 93.9%, P = 0.000). Follow-up time in some studies was insufficient, only eight studies reported OS, we systematically analyzed these eight studies and extracted the pooled mOS was 16.65 months (95% CI, 14.17-19.14) (I(2) = 76.9%, P = 0.000). In terms of safety, the incidence rates of any grade AEs, ranked from high to low, were as follows: aminotransferase increased (61.3%), nausea and vomiting (40.5%), hypertension (37.8%), thrombocytopenia (37.4%), hyperbilirubinemia (36.7%), abdominal pain (35.6%), leukopenia (34.6%), hypothyroidism (19.0%), rash (14.4%). Grade 3-4 AEs ranked from high to low were as follows: aminotransferase increased (10.8%), thrombocytopenia (7.9%), hypertension (7.4%), leukopenia (5.0%). No treatment-related deaths occurred, patients receiving this triple therapy demonstrated favorable tolerability. CONCLUSION: The combination of hepatic arterial infusion chemotherapy with tyrosine kinase inhibitors and immune checkpoint inhibitors as a first-line therapy for unresectable advanced HCC demonstrates promising therapeutic efficacy and favorable safety.",0.5725616952746136

Bayesian network meta-analysis was conducted to compare the efficacy and safety of different interventional strategies for uHCC. METHODS: A systematic search was conducted in PubMed, Embase, the Cochrane Library, Web of Science, and CNKI databases. Bayesian network meta-analysis was applied to evaluate the disease control rate (DCR), 1-year survival rate and 2-year survival rate, as well as the incidence of serious adverse events associated with seven interventional strategies. Odds ratios (ORs) were estimated using pairwise and network meta-analysis with random effects. Treatment rankings utilized surface under the cumulative ranking curve (SUCRA), whereas heterogeneity was examined via I-square and meta-regression. RESULTS: A total of 40 randomized controlled studies were included. Compared with transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) alone, all of the combination treatments, including TACE with radiofrequency ablation (RFA), microwave ablation (MWA), high-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU), percutaneous ethanol injection (PEI), and radiotherapy (RT), significantly improved the DCR. TACE combined with RFA was observed to be superior to hepatic arterial infusion chemotherapy (HAIC) (OR: 1.91; 95% CI: 1.03-3.81) and TACE (OR: 3.85; 95% CI: 2.66-5.69), with the highest probability (SUCRA 0.836). TACE combined with HIFU ranks highest 1-year survival (SUCRA 0.919) and 2-year survival (SUCRA 0.925) rates, and also exhibited a better 1-year survival rate than HAIC (OR: 2.99; 95% CI: 1.09-9.03). Compared with TACE alone, HAIC exhibited a greater DCR (OR: 2.02; 95% CI: 1.15-3.40) and a potential advantage in 2-year survival (OR: 1.95; 95% CI: 1.02-3.78). No significant differences in serious adverse events were observed across treatments. CONCLUSIONS: Compared with TACE alone, combined treatments for uHCC patients demonstrates better efficacy and survival. Moreover, compared with TACE and HAIC, TACE combined with RFA provides better efficacy, whereas TACE combined with HIFU offers the highest 1-year survival rate.

Observational studies have explored atezolizumab plus bevacizumab versus lenvatinib, yielding mixed results. This systematic review and meta-analysis aim to compare efficacy and safety of both treatment arms. METHODS: A systematic literature review was conducted in accordance with PRISMA guidelines. Randomized control trials, cohort studies, or case-control that included patients above age 60 with unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma confirmed by radiological imaging were included. At least one of the outcomes: overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS), objective response rate (ORR), duration of response, or adverse events was included in the selected studies. RESULTS: Ten cohorts were included in the analysis with a total of 6493 patients. Nine of the included studies had patients with advanced HCC (BCLC-C) or intermediate HCC (BCLC-B) and 1 study included patients with all three stages (BCLC-A, BCLC-B, and BCLC-C). Of these patients, 2524 patients received atezolizumab plus bevacizumab (A + B) combination while 3969 received lenvatinib. The overall survival was better statistically in the A + B group then the lenvatinib group (MD: - 5.06; 95% CI: - 7.79 to - 2.33; p = 0.0003, I(2) = 0%).

METHODS: A systematic literature search was conducted on PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science, Scopus, and the Cochrane Library between 2007 and 2024 focusing on studies reporting conversion therapy for HCC. The treatment groups were divided into Tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI), TKI plus loco-regional therapy (LRT), TKI plus anti-PD-1 therapy (TKI + PD-1), TKI + PD-1 + LRT, immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) plus LRT, and Atezolizumab plus bevacizumab (A + T) groups. The conversion to surgery rate (CSR), objective response rate (ORR), grade >/= 3 treatment-related adverse events (AEs), overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) were analyzed. RESULTS: 38 studies and 4,042 patients were included. The pooled CSR were 8% (95% CI, 5-12%) in TKI group, 13% (95% CI, 8-19%) in TKI + LRT group, 28% (95% CI, 19-37%) in TKI + PD-1 group, 33% (95% CI, 25-41%) in TKI + PD-1 + LRT group, 23% (95% CI, 1-46%) in ICI + LRT group, and 5% (95% CI, 3-8%) in A + T group, respectively.

Although the response to targeted therapies for unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is acceptable with the improved survival, the high tumor recurrence rate and drug-related side effects continue to be problematic. Given that immune checkpoint inhibitor alone are not robust enough to improve survival in unresectable HCC, growing evidence supports the combination of targeted therapy and immunotherapy with synergistic effect. METHODS: Online databases including PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, and Web of Science were searched for the studies that compared targeted monotherapy with the combination therapy of targeted drug and checkpoint inhibitors in unresectable HCC patients. Eligibility criteria were the presence of at least one measurable lesion as defined by the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (version 1.1) for unresectable HCC patients, an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0-2, and a Child-Pugh score </= 7. Outcome measurements include overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS), and treatment-related adverse event (TRAE). RESULTS: Three phase II/III randomized controlled trials were included in this study. The pooled results showed that combination therapy significantly improved survival than targeted monotherapy, in terms of OS (hazard ratio (HR) = 0.67; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.50-0.91) and PFS (HR = 0.58; 95% CI: 0.51-0.67), respectively.

CONCLUSION: For unresectable HCC, combined targeted drug and immunotherapy significantly improved survival compared with targeted monotherapy. However, the incidences of AEs of combinational therapy were higher than targeted monotherapy.",0.5675851682362079

Combining transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) with tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) and immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) has emerged as a promising strategy to enhance treatment efficacy. This meta-analysis evaluates efficacy and safety of TACE + TKIs + ICIs compared to TKIs + ICIs alone in patients with HCC. METHODS: A systematic search was conducted across ""PubMed"", ""Web of Science"", ""Cochrane Library"", ""Scopus"", ""Google Scholar"", and ""Embase"" to screen studies up to November 2024. Studies comparing TACE + TKIs + ICIs with TKIs + ICIs alone in advanced HCC were included. Outcomes of interest included objective response rate (ORR), disease control rate (DCR), overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS), and adverse events. Results were reported as relative risk (RR) or hazard ratios (HR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI). Funnel plots was used to assess publication bias. RESULTS: Ten studies comprising 1999 patients were included. The combination of TACE + TKIs + ICIs marked improved ORR (RR = 1.81, 95%CI:1.57-2.09, P < 0.00001) and DCR (RR = 1.32, 95%CI: 1.19-1.46, P < 0.00001) comparing with TKIs + ICIs alone.

This meta-analysis was performed to evaluate the efficacy of adding HAIC to lenvatinib in combination with programmed death-1 (PD-1) inhibitors. METHODS: Literature related to the efficacy of HAIC in combination with lenvatinib plus PD-1 inhibitors in the treatment of advanced HCC was searched through PubMed, Cochrane Library, Embase, and Web of Science databases. TSA was used to control for the risk of random error and assess whether the meta-analysis evidence was conclusive. RESULTS: Eight relevant papers with a total of 1244 patients. Compared with the L-P treatment group, the H-L-P treatment group significantly prolonged OS (hazard ratio [HR] 2.11 [95 % confidence interval (CI) 1.82-2.44]; p < 0.001) and PFS (HR 1.91 [95 % CI 1.67-2.17]; p < 0.001) and improved ORR (risk ratio [RR] 2.20 [95 % CI 1.74-2.78]; p < 0.001) and DCR (RR 1.28 [95 % CI 1.15-1.42]; p < 0.001) in patients with advanced HCC.

However, survival remains poor with only a subset of patients deriving benefit. This trial investigated the safety and efficacy of stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) with immunotherapy in HCC. METHODS AND MATERIALS: In this multicenter phase 1 randomized trial, patients with advanced or unresectable HCC received liver SBRT (40 Gy in 5 fractions) followed by either nivolumab alone or nivolumab plus ipilimumab. The primary endpoint was dose-limiting toxicity occurring within 6 months of SBRT. Secondary endpoints included overall response rate, progression-free survival, overall survival (OS), distant disease control, and local control of the irradiated tumor. Disease status and response endpoints were assessed radiographically every 8 weeks until progression or initiation of nonprotocol therapy. Response was determined using both RECIST (Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors) 1.1 and iRECIST. RESULTS: Fourteen patients were enrolled across 3 centers. Thirteen patients were evaluated for study endpoints. The study was closed early because of slow accrual. The median follow-up time was 42.7 months. Dose-limiting toxicities within 6 months occurred in 2 (15.4%) of 13 patients: 1 of 6 patients in the nivolumab arm (16.7%; 90% confidence interval [CI], 0.9%-58.2%) and 1 of 7 patients in the nivolumab plus ipilimumab arm (14.3%; 90% CI, 0.7%-52.1%). Grade 3 adverse events occurred in 8 (61.6%), 5 (71.4%), and 3 (50.0%) patients in the overall nivolumab plus ipilimumab and nivolumab cohorts. Grade 3 hepatotoxicity occurred in 4 (30.8%), 3 (42.9%), and 1 (16.7%) patients in the respective cohorts. Clinical outcomes favored the nivolumab plus ipilimumab arm compared with nivolumab alone, including an overall response rate of 57% (4 of 7 patients; 90% CI, 23%-87%) versus 0% (0 of 6 patients; 90% CI, 0%-39%), median progression-free survival of 11.6 months (90% CI, 4.5 months to not reached) versus 2.7 months (90% CI, 1.3-4.7 months), and median OS of 41.6 months (90% CI, 4.5 months to not reached) versus 4.7 months (90% CI, 2.0-16.2 months) (all P < .05). With combination immunotherapy, 3-year OS was 57% (90% CI, 23%-81%), with 2 patients alive after 42.7 months without progression and negative PET. CONCLUSIONS: In this first prospective trial investigating the combination of SBRT and immunotherapy for HCC, multimodal therapy demonstrated acceptable safety. SBRT with nivolumab plus ipilimumab compared favorably to outcomes of immunotherapy alone and warrants further investigation.",0.5626483895951134

However, surgeons are concerned that adverse effects of neoadjuvant therapy with these agents could lead to delayed or even cancelled surgeries. OBJECTIVE: To summarize the current evidence regarding toxicity profiles for tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) and immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) among patients with HCC. DATA SOURCES: Medline, Embase, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) were searched from January 1990 and December 2021. STUDY SELECTION: Single-group, placebo-controlled, and dual-agent clinical trials comparing TKIs and ICIs in patients with HCC were eligible for inclusion. DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS: Following the Preferred Reporting Items in Systematic Reviews and Meta-analysis guideline, 2 reviewers independently extracted data. A random-effects model was used. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcome was the proportion of patients with clinically significant liver-related adverse events. Secondary outcomes included the proportion of patients who experienced clinically relevant (grade 3 or higher) adverse events and significant adverse events (ie, those that were life threatening, required hospitalization, or prolonged disability) as well as the risk ratio (RR) of these complications. RESULTS: Overall, 30 studies with 12 921 patients were included. Patients had a mean (range) age of 62 (18-89) years; a mean (SD) 84% (3) were male; a mean (SD) 82% (16) had Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer stage C HCC; and a mean (SD) 97% (6) had Childs A cirrhosis. Overall, 21% (95% CI, 16%-26%) of patients receiving TKIs had liver toxic effects compared with 28% (95% CI, 21%-35%) of patients receiving ICIs. Severe adverse events occurred in 46% (95% CI, 40%-51%) of patients receiving TKIs compared with 24% (95% CI, 13%-35%) of patients receiving ICIs. Compared with patients receiving sorafenib, other TKIs were associated with similar rates of liver toxic effects (RR, 1.06; 95% CI, 0.92-1.24) but higher rates of severe adverse events (RR, 1.24; 95% CI, 1.07-1.44). Comparing ICIs with sorafenib, there were similar rates of liver toxic effects (RR, 1.10; 95% CI, 0.86-1.40) and severe adverse events (RR, 1.19; 95% CI, 0.95-1.50). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this systematic review and meta-analysis, serious adverse events were lower with ICIs than with TKIs, while liver toxic effects were similar. Combination therapy with novel ICIs is an appealing option in trials of neoadjuvant therapy for patients with HCC, requiring evaluation in preoperative trials.",0.5622519933129386

METHODS: A partitioned survival model was developed to estimate the clinical and economic outcomes of donafenib, sorafenib, and lenvatinib for advanced HCC. The key clinical data of these targeted therapies were assessed through a network meta-analysis. The cost and health utilities were mainly collected from the literature. Quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), costs, and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICER) were the primary outcomes. Model uncertainty was tested with one-way sensitivity analyses, scenario analyses, and probabilistic sensitivity analyses (PSA). RESULTS: For health outcomes, donafenib gained the highest QALYs among the three treatments, followed by lenvatinib and sorafenib (1.106, 0.999, and 0.915 QALYs, respectively). For cost, donafenib was the cheapest option, followed by sorafenib and lenvatinib ($42,116, $43,193, and $44,261). The PSA indicated that the probability of being cost-effective for donafenib was 86.98% and 93.56% when the willingness-to-pay thresholds were one and three times the gross domestic product per capita in China, respectively. The one-way sensitivity analyses and scenario analyses also found the results to be robust. CONCLUSION: Compared to sorafenib and lenvatinib, donafenib was likely to be a cost-effective treatment with the highest QALYs and the lowest cost for patients with advanced HCC in China.",0.5620610896748913

We performed a meta-analysis to characterize tumor response and survival associated with multimodal treatment of HCC. METHODS: PubMed, Embase, Medline, Scopus, and CINAHL databases were searched (1990-2022). Random-effect meta-analysis was conducted to compare efficacy of treatment modalities. Odds ratios (OR) and standardized mean difference (SMD) were reported. RESULTS: Thirty studies (4170 patients) met inclusion criteria. Triple therapy regimen (ICI + TKI + TACE) had the highest overall disease control rate (DCR) (87%, 95% CI 83-91), while ICI + radiotherapy had the highest objective response rate (ORR) (72%, 95% CI 54%-89%). Triple therapy had a higher DCR than ICI + TACE (OR 4.49, 95% CI 2.09-9.63), ICI + TKI (OR 3.08, 95% CI 1.63-5.82), and TKI + TACE (OR 2.90, 95% CI 1.61-5.20). Triple therapy demonstrated improved overall survival versus ICI + TKI (SMD 0.72, 95% CI 0.37-1.07) and TKI + TACE (SMD 1.13, 95% CI 0.70-1.48) (both p < 0.05). Triple therapy had a greater incidence of adverse events (AEs) compared with ICI + TKI (OR 0.59, 95% CI 0.29-0.91; p = 0.02), but no difference in AEs versus ICI + TACE or TKI + TACE (both p > 0.05). CONCLUSION: The combination of ICIs, TKIs and TACE demonstrated superior tumor response and survival and should be considered for select patients with advanced HCC.",0.5608806839150934

The aim of the study was to explore the interaction of prognostic factors with survival in study cohorts receiving IMB or TKI. METHODS: A systematic search was performed and single arms of phase III trials including IMB or TKI were selected. Analysis of IMB and TKI cohorts was performed, and the relationship between progression-free survival (PFS) with OS was assessed. Finally, 13 variables were extracted, and their relationships with survival in the two groups were evaluated. RESULTS: Thirty-three study cohorts were selected. Longer OS and post-progression survival (PPS) were evident in the group of IMB, while the relationship of PFS with OS was significant only in the TKI cohorts (beta = 0.527, p = 0.007). Prognostic factors in the IMB cohorts did not report any significant relationship with OS, while among patients receiving TKIs, longer OS was documented with elder age (beta = 0.577, p = 0.003) and good performance status (beta = 0.500, p = 0.011). Conversely, in the IMB cohorts, PPS increased with hepatitis B virus (HBV) (beta = 0.756, p = 0.030) and Barcelona Clinic Liver Classification (BCLC) stage (beta = 0.898, p = 0.002). CONCLUSION: In contrast to TKIs, IMBs improved the outcome of patients with aHCC by increasing PPS, particularly in patients with BCLC stage C and HBV-related hepatopathy, but the outcome improvement was lost in patients with hepatitis C virus-related liver disease.",0.5603164375376144

The endpoints were the objective response rate (ORR), disease control rate (DCR), conversion rate, progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), and the incidence of adverse events (AEs). Stratified analyses were accomplished based on local treatment and evaluation criteria. Totally, 4930 individuals from 76 studies were recruited. For initial uHCC treated with the triple therapy, the pooled pathologic complete response (pCR) rate, major pathologic response (MPR) rate, and conversion resection rate were 29.91%, 44.81%, and 30.98%; the ORR and DCR were 38.52% and 84.42% according to RECIST 1.1, 57.82% and 85.82% by mRECIST 1.1.

We analyze whether objective response (OR) is an independent predictor and surrogate endpoint of OS. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A systematic review of randomized clinical trials (RCT) in advanced HCC published between 2010 and 2020 was conducted to explore OS surrogacy of OR by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) and modified RECIST (mRECIST). In parallel, RCTs exploring the impact of OR on OS in a time-dependent multivariate analysis were integrated in a meta-analysis. RESULTS: Of 65 RCTs identified in advanced HCC, we analyzed 34 studies including 14,056 patients that reported OS and OR by either RECIST (n = 23), mRECIST (n = 5), or both (n = 6). When exploring surrogacy, the trial-level correlation between OR odds ratio and OS HR was R = 0.677 by mRECIST and R = 0.532 by RECIST. Meta-analysis of five RCTs assessing predictors of survival in multivariate analysis found that patients with OR by mRECIST presented a pooled HR for OS of 0.44 (95% confidence interval, 0.27-0.70; P < 0.001) compared with nonresponders. Responses to atezolizumab-bevacizumab had a greater impact on OS than tyrosine kinase inhibitor responses. CONCLUSIONS: OR-mRECIST is an independent predictor of OS in patients with advanced HCC. Although correlation of OR-mRECIST and OS is better than with OR-RECIST, the level of surrogacy is modest. Thus, it can be used as endpoint in proof-of-concept phase II trials, but the data do not support its use as a primary endpoint of phase III investigations assessing systemic therapies.",0.5592823523097739

The rapid development of immunotherapy utilizing immune checkpoint inhibitors for advanced HCC patients has been witnessed in recent years, along with numerous randomized clinical trials demonstrating the survival benefits for these individuals. This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to identify specific clinico-pathological characteristics of advanced HCC patients that may lead to preferable responses to immunotherapy in terms of overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS), and objective response rate (ORR). METHODS: The included clinical trials were retrieved from PubMed, Embase, the Cochrane library, and the Web of Science databases published in English between 1 January 2002 and 20 October 2022. A systematic review and meta-analysis for first-line and second-line phase II/III studies were conducted on immunotherapy for patients with advanced HCC by using OS as the primary outcome measure, and PFS and ORR as the secondary outcome measures to obtain clinico-pathological characteristics of patients which might be preferable responses to programmed death-1 (PD-1) and programmed cell death-Ligand 1 (PD-L1) inhibitors. Toxicity and specific treatment-related adverse events (TRAEs) were also determined. RESULTS: After screening 1392 relevant studies, 12 studies were included in this systematic review and meta-analysis to include 5948 patients. Based on the analysis of interaction, the difference in OS after first-line immunotherapy between the subgroups of viral hepatitis [hazard ratio (HR)=0.73 vs 0.87, P for interaction=0.02] and macrovascular invasion and/or extrahepatic spread (HR=0.73 vs 0.89, P for interaction=0.02) were significant. The difference in PFS between the subgroups of viral hepatitis was highly significant (pooled HR=0.55 vs 0.81, P for interaction=0.007). After second-line immunotherapy, the difference in ORR between the subgroups of Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer was significant (pooled ES=0.12 vs 0.23, P for interaction=0.04). Compared with PD-L1 inhibitors, PD-1 inhibitors may have a higher probability to cause TRAEs. Diarrhea, increased aspartate aminotransferase, and hypertension were the top three TRAEs. CONCLUSIONS: This systematic review and meta-analysis represents the first pilot study aimed at identifying crucial clinico-pathological characteristics of patients with advanced HCC that may predict favorable treatment outcomes in terms of OS, PFS, and ORR to immunotherapy. Findings suggest that patients with viral hepatitis positivity (especially hepatitis B virus) and macrovascular invasion and/or extrahepatic spread may benefit more in OS when treated with PD-1/PD-L1 immune checkpoint inhibitors.",0.5592237095077159

The COSMIC-312 trial assessed cabozantinib plus atezolizumab versus sorafenib as first-line systemic treatment for advanced hepatocellular carcinoma. METHODS: COSMIC-312 is an open-label, randomised, phase 3 trial that enrolled patients aged 18 years or older with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma not amenable to curative or locoregional therapy and previously untreated with systemic anticancer therapy at 178 centres in 32 countries. Patients with fibrolamellar carcinoma, sarcomatoid hepatocellular carcinoma, or combined hepatocellular cholangiocarcinoma were not eligible. Tumours involving major blood vessels, including the main portal vein, were permitted. Patients were required to have measurable disease per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors version 1.1 (RECIST 1.1), Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer stage B or C disease, an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0 or 1, adequate organ and marrow function, and Child-Pugh class A. Previous resection, tumour ablation, radiotherapy, or arterial chemotherapy was allowed if more than 28 days before randomisation. Patients were randomly assigned (2:1:1) via a web-based interactive response system to cabozantinib 40 mg orally once daily plus atezolizumab 1200 mg intravenously every 3 weeks, sorafenib 400 mg orally twice daily, or single-agent cabozantinib 60 mg orally once daily. Randomisation was stratified by disease aetiology, geographical region, and presence of extrahepatic disease or macrovascular invasion. Dual primary endpoints were progression-free survival per RECIST 1.1 as assessed by a blinded independent radiology committee in the first 372 patients randomly assigned to the combination treatment of cabozantinib plus atezolizumab or sorafenib (progression-free survival intention-to-treat [ITT] population), and overall survival in all patients randomly assigned to cabozantinib plus atezolizumab or sorafenib (ITT population). Final progression-free survival and concurrent interim overall survival analyses are presented. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03755791. FINDINGS: Analyses at data cut-off (March 8, 2021) included the first 837 patients randomly assigned between Dec 7, 2018, and Aug 27, 2020, to combination treatment of cabozantinib plus atezolizumab (n=432), sorafenib (n=217), or single-agent cabozantinib (n=188). Median follow-up was 15.8 months (IQR 14.5-17.2) in the progression-free survival ITT population and 13.3 months (10.5-16.0) in the ITT population. Median progression-free survival was 6.8 months (99% CI 5.6-8.3) in the combination treatment group versus 4.2 months (2.8-7.0) in the sorafenib group (hazard ratio [HR] 0.63, 99% CI 0.44-0.91, p=0.0012). Median overall survival (interim analysis) was 15.4 months (96% CI 13.7-17.7) in the combination treatment group versus 15.5 months (12.1-not estimable) in the sorafenib group (HR 0.90, 96% CI 0.69-1.18; p=0.44). The most common grade 3 or 4 adverse events were alanine aminotransferase increase (38 [9%] of 429 patients in the combination treatment group vs six [3%] of 207 in the sorafenib group vs 12 [6%] of 188 in the single-agent cabozantinib group), hypertension (37 [9%] vs 17 [8%] vs 23 [12%]), aspartate aminotransferase increase (37 [9%] vs eight [4%] vs 18 [10%]), and palmar-plantar erythrodysaesthesia (35 [8%] vs 17 [8%] vs 16 [9%]); serious treatment-related adverse events occurred in 78 (18%) patients in the combination treatment group, 16 (8%) patients in the sorafenib group, and 24 (13%) in the single-agent cabozantinib group. Treatment-related grade 5 events occurred in six (1%) patients in the combination treatment group (encephalopathy, hepatic failure, drug-induced liver injury, oesophageal varices haemorrhage, multiple organ dysfunction syndrome, and tumour lysis syndrome), one (<1%) patient in the sorafenib group (general physical health deterioration), and one (<1%) patient in the single-agent cabozantinib group (gastrointestinal haemorrhage).

Traditional treatments for advanced HCC have limited efficacy, prompting the exploration of combination therapies. This systematic review and meta-analysis evaluate the effectiveness and safety of combining PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors with anti-angiogenic agents in patients with unresectable HCC. METHODS: A comprehensive literature search was conducted in PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), and Web of Science, including studies up to June 2024. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing combination therapy (PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors with anti-angiogenic agents) to monotherapy or standard treatments in unresectable HCC patients were included. Data were synthesized using random-effects models, with pooled hazard ratios (HRs) for overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS), and risk ratios (RRs) for objective response rate (ORR) and adverse events (AEs). RESULTS: Five Phase III RCTs involving 1515 patients were included. Combination therapy significantly improved OS (HR: 0.71, 95% CI: 0.60-0.85) and PFS (HR: 0.64, 95% CI: 0.53-0.77) compared to monotherapy or standard treatments. The pooled OR for ORR was 1.27 (95% CI: 1.57-2.11), indicating a higher response rate with combination therapy. However, the risk of AEs was also higher in the combination therapy group (RR: 1.04, 95% CI: 1.02-1.06). Subgroup analyses revealed consistent benefits across different types of PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors and anti-angiogenic agents, with no significant publication bias detected. CONCLUSIONS: The combination of PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors with anti-angiogenic agents offers significant benefits in improving OS and PFS in patients with unresectable HCC, although it is associated with an increased risk of adverse events.",0.557648275377254

PATIENTS AND METHODS: In the multicenter, two-stage, and randomized phase 1/2 trial, patients were randomly assigned to receive toripalimab alone (240 mg, every 3 weeks), subtotal local ablation followed by toripalimab starting on post-ablation day 3 (Schedule D3), or on post-ablation day 14 (Schedule D14). The first endpoint of stage 1 was to determine which combination schedule could continue and progression-free survival (PFS) as the primary endpoint for stage 1/2. RESULTS: A total of 146 patients were recruited. During stage 1, Schedule D3 achieved numerically higher objective response rate (ORR) than Schedule D14 for non-ablation lesions (37.5% vs. 31.3%), and was chosen for stage 2 evaluation. For the entire cohort of both stages, patients with Schedule D3 had a significantly higher ORR than with toripalimab alone (33.8% vs. 16.9%; P = 0.027). Moreover, patients with Schedule D3 had improved median PFS (7.1 vs. 3.8 months; P < 0.001) and median overall survival (18.4 vs. 13.2 months; P = 0.005), as compared with toripalimab alone. In addition, six (9%) patients with toripalimab, eight (12%) with Schedule D3, and 4 (25%) with Schedule D14 developed grade 3 or 4 adverse events, and one patient (2%) with Schedule D3 manifested grade 5 treatment-related pneumonitis.

Our aim was to assess overall survival for resection, identify poor prognostic factors, and to compare it to trans-arterial chemotherapy (TACE) where data was available. RESULTS: Eighty-nine articles were included after a complete database search in the systematic review as per our predefined criteria. Analysis revealed a 5-year overall survival of 33.5% for resection of HCC > 10 cm, 41.7% for BCLC B, 23.3% for BCLC C, and 36.6% for multinodular HCC. Peri-operative mortality ranged from 0 to 6.9%. Studies comparing resection versus TACE for BCLC B/C had a survival of 40% versus 17%, respectively.

Patients are often diagnosed with advanced disease, in which systemic and locoregional therapies are commonly used as first-line treatment. Such treatments can cause adverse events (AEs) that negatively affect quality of life (QoL), which is particularly undesirable where prognosis is poor. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the impact of common AEs on QoL in patients with HCC. METHODS: Data from the SARAH randomized controlled trial (RCT) were analyzed. Given the large number of distinct AEs that occurred in the trial, AEs were grouped as in the SARAH trial and prioritized using principal component analysis (PCA). Linear mixed-effects models were then applied with age, ECOG status, and AEs as predictors of the QoL change as measured with the EORTC Core Quality of Life Questionnaire (QLQ-C30). RESULTS: The PCA resulted in the selection of 28 AEs for inclusion in the linear mixed-effects models. Of the 28 AEs, diarrhea, decreased appetite, abdominal pain, and palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia syndrome (hand-foot syndrome) were significant drivers of reductions in QoL as measured using the QLQ-C30 global health status scale. Diarrhea, abdominal pain, and hand-foot syndrome were also significant drivers of reduced QoL outcomes. CONCLUSION: The present analysis showed that diarrhea, decreased appetite, abdominal pain, and palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia were significantly associated with reduced QoL in patients with unresectable HCC. Reducing the incidence and/or severity of these AEs should therefore be a key focus when selecting the optimal treatments for these patients.",0.5553551829790523

However, the superiority of combination therapy to TACE monotherapy remains controversial. Therefore, here we performed a meta-analysis to evaluate the efficacy and safety of TACE plus TKIs in patients with uHCC. METHODS: We searched four databases for eligible studies. The primary outcome was time to progression (TTP), while the secondary outcomes were overall survival (OS), tumor response rates, and adverse events (AEs). Pooled hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) were collected for TTP and OS, and the data were analyzed using random-effects meta-analysis models in STATA software. OR and 95% CIs were used to estimate dichotomous variables (complete remission[CR], partial remission[PR], stable disease[SD], progressive disease[PD], objective response rate[ORR], disease control rate[DCR], and AEs) using RStudio's random-effects model. Quality assessments were performed using the Newcastle-Ottawa scale (NOS) for observational studies and the Cochrane risk of bias tool for randomized controlled trials (RCTs). RESULTS: The meta-analysis included 30 studies (9 RCTs, 21 observational studies) with 8246 patients. We judged the risk of bias as low in 44.4% (4/9) of the RCTs and high in 55.6% (5/9) of the RCTs. All observational studies were considered of high quality, with a NOS score of at least 6. Compared with TACE alone or TACE plus placebo, TACE combined with TKIs was superior in prolonging TTP (combined HR 0.72, 95% CI 0.65-0.80), OS (combined HR 0.57, 95% CI 0.49-0.67), and objective response rate (OR 2.13, 95% CI 1.23-3.67) in patients with uHCC. However, TACE plus TKIs caused a higher incidence of AEs, especially hand-foot skin reactions (OR 87.17%, 95%CI 42.88-177.23), diarrhea (OR 18.13%, 95%CI 9.32-35.27), and hypertension (OR 12.24%, 95%CI 5.89-25.42). CONCLUSIONS: Our meta-analysis found that TACE plus TKIs may be beneficial for patients with uHCC in terms of TTP, OS, and tumor response rates. However, combination therapy is also associated with a significantly increased risk of adverse reactions. Therefore, we must evaluate the clinical benefits and risks of combination therapy. Further well-designed RCTs are needed to confirm our findings. TRIAL REGISTRATION: PROSPERO registration number: CRD42022298003.",0.5512628493175373

METHODS: In cohort 6 of the multicohort, open-label, phase I/II CheckMate 040 study, patients who were treatment-naive, sorafenib-intolerant, or had progressed on sorafenib were randomly assigned 1:1 to nivolumab 240 mg once every 2 weeks plus cabozantinib 40 mg once daily (doublet arm); or nivolumab 3 mg/kg every 2 weeks plus cabozantinib 40 mg once daily with ipilimumab 1 mg/kg once every 6 weeks (triplet arm). Primary objectives were safety and tolerability, objective response rate, and duration of response by investigator assessment per RECIST v1.1. Secondary objectives included progression-free survival (by blinded independent central review) and overall survival. RESULTS: Seventy-one patients were randomly assigned: 36 to the doublet arm and 35 to the triplet arm. After 32.0-month median follow-up, objective response rate (95% CI) was 17% (6 to 33) and 29% (15 to 46) in the doublet and triplet arms, respectively. Median (95% CI) duration of response was 8.3 (6.9 to not estimable) months in the doublet arm and not reached (0.0 to not estimable) in the triplet arm. Median progression-free survival was 5.1 and 4.3 months, and median overall survival was 20.2 and 22.1 months for the doublet and triplet arms, respectively. Grade 3-4 treatment-related adverse events occurred in 50% and 74% of patients and treatment-related adverse events leading to discontinuation were reported for 11% and 23% in the doublet and triplet arms, respectively.

This study compares oncologic outcomes after ablation, liver resection, and liver transplantation for solitary, small hepatocellular carcinoma. METHODS: We systematically searched databases up to 7 February 2022, for studies including adults with solitary hepatocellular carcinoma </=3 cm treated by any ablation, liver resection, or liver transplantation. We excluded non-hepatocellular carcinoma cancers, recurrent/metastatic diseases, and alternative therapies. A frequentist network meta-analysis assessed 5-year overall survival and recurrence-free survival using only adjusted effect estimates while accounting for bias risk. RESULTS: We identified 80 studies (4 randomized controlled trials, 72 retrospectives, and 4 prospective cohorts) with 28,211 patients. In the network meta-analysis for 5-year overall survival (26 studies), liver transplantation was associated with the lowest mortality hazard (hazard ratio, 0.47; 95% confidence interval, 0.31-0.73, referenced to liver resection), followed by liver resection (reference), whereas ablation had the greatest mortality hazard (hazard ratio, 1.32; 95% confidence interval, 1.16-1.49, referenced to liver resection). For 5-year recurrence-free survival (19 studies), liver transplantation had the best outcome (hazard ratio, 0.36; 95% confidence interval, 0.20-0.63, referenced to liver transplantation), followed by liver resection (reference), with ablation showing the least favorable outcome (hazard ratio, 1.67; 95% confidence interval, 1.45-1.93, referenced to liver resection). CONCLUSIONS: This network meta-analysis provides the evidence for comparing treatment modality outcomes for solitary, small (</=3 cm) hepatocellular carcinoma. LT emerges as the superior choice for achieving a better 5-year OS, followed by liver resection, then ablation. When feasible to preserve liver function, liver resection can be prioritized. Ablation with close surveillance should be reserved for individuals unfit for surgery.",0.5504721934590515

METHODS: Seventy HCC patients were enrolled for our study, and they were randomized by simple randomization using computer-generated random numbers into two groups: control group and observation group. Regular follow-up reviews were conducted to assess the efficacy of treatments. The levels of apoptotic factors, the levels of hepatic fibrosis indices, the levels of serum tumor vascular factors and tumor markers, and the occurrence of adverse reactions in the two groups were recorded and compared. RESULTS: Disease control rate, objective response rate, and progression-free survival (PFS) of patients in the observation group were higher in contrast to the control group. After 12 weeks of treatment, lower mRNA expression of c-mesenchymal-epithelial transition factor, telomerase, and Fas Ligand and higher mRNA expression of Fas and Caspase-3 were observed in HCC tissues of the observation group versus the control group (p < 0.05); lower detection values of serum laminin, hyaluronic acid, collage type IV, vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2, and alpha-fetal protein (AFP) were noted in HCC patients of the observation group in comparison to the control group (p < 0.05); there was no difference in the incidence of adverse reactions between the two groups. CONCLUSION: Donafenib combined with HAIC in the treatment of unresectable HCC patients can notably reduce serum AFP levels, improve hepatic fibrosis, enhance short-term efficacy, prolong PFS, and have a favorable safety profile.",0.5499869420171467

We report results from the preplanned interim analysis of the CheckMate 9DW trial assessing nivolumab plus ipilimumab versus lenvatinib or sorafenib for unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma in the first-line setting. METHODS: This open-label, randomised, phase 3 trial enrolled patients aged 18 years or older with unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma without previous systemic therapy at 163 hospitals and cancer centres across 25 countries in Asia, Australia, Europe, North America, and South America. Patients had at least one measurable untreated lesion per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumours (RECIST) version 1.1, a Child-Pugh score of 5 or 6, and an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0 or 1. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) via an interactive response technology system to receive nivolumab (1 mg/kg) plus ipilimumab (3 mg/kg) intravenously every 3 weeks for up to four doses, followed by nivolumab 480 mg every 4 weeks or investigator's choice of either oral lenvatinib (8 mg or 12 mg mg daily depending on bodyweight) or oral sorafenib (400 mg twice daily). Randomisation was stratified by aetiology; the presence of macrovascular invasion, extrahepatic spread, or both; and baseline alpha-fetoprotein concentration. The primary endpoint was overall survival, which was assessed in all randomly assigned patients; safety was an exploratory endpoint and was assessed in all randomly assigned patients who received at least one dose of study medication. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04039607 (ongoing). FINDINGS: Between Jan 6, 2020, and Nov 8, 2021, 668 patients were randomly assigned to nivolumab plus ipilimumab (n=335) or lenvatinib or sorafenib (n=333). Early crossing of the overall survival Kaplan-Meier curves reflected a higher number of deaths during the first 6 months after randomisation with nivolumab plus ipilimumab (hazard ratio 1.65 [95% CI 1.12-2.43]) but was followed by a sustained separation of the curves thereafter in favour of nivolumab plus ipilimumab (0.61 [0.48-0.77]). After a median follow-up of 35.2 months (IQR 31.1-39.9), overall survival was significantly improved with nivolumab plus ipilimumab versus lenvatinib or sorafenib (median 23.7 months [95% CI 18.8-29.4] vs 20.6 months [17.5-22.5]; hazard ratio 0.79 [0.65-0.96]; two-sided stratified log-rank p=0.018); respective overall survival rates were 49% (95% CI 44-55) versus 39% (34-45) at 24 months and 38% (32-43) versus 24% (19-30) at 36 months. Overall, 137 (41%) of 332 patients receiving nivolumab plus ipilimumab and 138 (42%) of 325 patients receiving lenvatinib or sorafenib had grade 3-4 treatment-related adverse events. 12 deaths were attributed to treatment with nivolumab plus ipilimumab and three were attributed to treatment with lenvatinib or sorafenib. INTERPRETATION: Nivolumab plus ipilimumab showed a significant overall survival benefit versus lenvatinib or sorafenib and manageable safety in patients with previously untreated unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma. These results support nivolumab plus ipilimumab as a first-line treatment in this setting. FUNDING: Bristol Myers Squibb.",0.5494499237928553

This study aims to perform an updated meta-analysis of trials comparing upfront immunotherapy-based regimens versus tyrosin-kinase inhibitors, and some exploratory analyses. METHODS: After a systematic review, randomized trials of immunotherapy-based regimens versus tyrosin-kinase inhibitors were selected. A meta-analysis assessed the relationship between treatment arm and overall survival. Based on the resulting heterogeneity, a further investigation of 11 variables by meta-regression and an exploration of subgroups were planned. RESULTS: Eight studies were selected. From the meta-analysis, the overall survival improvement for the immunotherapy-based arms was consistent (HR: 0.77, CI: 0.68-0.88), although heterogeneity between studies was significant ( Q =16.37; P =0.0373; I2 =51.1%). After meta-regression, the effect of the experimental arm was more pronounced in the elderly and lost among patients with HCV-related liver disease. Subgroups suggested a favorable effect of immunotherapy in patients with HBV-related hepatocellular carcinoma, extrahepatic dissemination, and elevated alpha-fetoprotein.

With the promising results of a double combination of transarterial chemo(embolization) and tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), and TKIs and immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs), a more aggressive strategy, a triple combination of transarterial chemo(embolization), TKIs, and ICIs has been tried in the recent years. Hence, we aimed to conduct a systematic review to verify the safety and efficacy of the triple therapy for uHCC. METHODS: PubMed, MedLine, Embase, the Cochrane Library, and Web of Knowledge were used to screen the eligible studies evaluating the clinical efficacy and safety of triple therapy for patients with uHCC up to April 25th 2022, as well as Chinese databases. The endpoints were the complete response (CR), objective response rate (ORR), disease control rate (DCR), conversion rate, progression-free survival (PFS) rate, overall survival (OS) rate, and the incidence of adverse events (AEs). RESULTS: A total of 15 studies were eligible with 741 patients receiving transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) or hepatic arterial infusion chemotherapy (HAIC) combined with TKIs and ICIs. The pooled rate and 95% confidence interval (CI) for CR, ORR, and DCR were 0.124 (0.069-0.190), 0.606 (0.528-0.682), and 0.885 (0.835-0.927). The pooled rates for PFS at 0.5 years and 1 year were 0.781 (0.688-0.862) and 0.387 (0.293-0.486), respectively. The pooled rates for OS at 1, 2, and 3 years were 0.690 (0.585-0.786), 0.212 (0.117-0.324), and 0.056 (0.028-0.091), respectively. In addition, the pooled rate and 95%CI for the conversion surgery was 0.359 (0.153-0.595). The subgroup analysis of control studies showed that triple therapy was superior to TACE+TKIs, TKIs+ICIs, and TKIs in CR, ORR, and DCR, conversion rate; PFS; and OS. No fatal AEs were reported, and the top three most common AEs were elevated ALT, elevated AST, and hypertension, as well as severe AEs (grading >/=3). CONCLUSION: With the current data, we concluded that the triple therapy of TACE/HAIC, TKIs, and ICIs would provide a clinical benefit for uHCC both in short- and long-term outcomes without increasing severe AEs, but the conclusion needs further validation.

Therefore, a clinical study was conducted to compare the efficacy and safety of the anti-PD-1 antibody camrelizumab plus the VEGFR2-targeted TKI rivoceranib (also known as apatinib) versus sorafenib as first-line treatment for unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma. METHODS: This randomised, open-label, international phase 3 trial (CARES-310) was done at 95 study sites across 13 countries and regions worldwide. Patients with unresectable or metastatic hepatocellular carcinoma who had not previously received any systemic treatment were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive either camrelizumab 200 mg intravenously every 2 weeks plus rivoceranib 250 mg orally once daily or sorafenib 400 mg orally twice daily. Randomisation was done via a centralised interactive response system. The primary endpoints were progression-free survival, as assessed by the blinded independent review committee per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumours version 1.1, and overall survival in the intention-to-treat population. Safety was assessed in all patients who received at least one dose of the study drugs. We report the findings from the prespecified primary analysis for progression-free survival and interim analysis for overall survival. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT03764293). FINDINGS: Between June 28, 2019, and March 24, 2021, 543 patients were randomly assigned to the camrelizumab-rivoceranib (n=272) or sorafenib (n=271) group. At the primary analysis for progression-free survival (May 10, 2021), median follow-up was 7.8 months (IQR 4.1-10.6). Median progression-free survival was significantly improved with camrelizumab-rivoceranib versus sorafenib (5.6 months [95% CI 5.5-6.3] vs 3.7 months [2.8-3.7]; hazard ratio [HR] 0.52 [95% CI 0.41-0.65]; one-sided p<0.0001). At the interim analysis for overall survival (Feb 8, 2022), median follow-up was 14.5 months (IQR 9.1-18.7). Median overall survival was significantly extended with camrelizumab-rivoceranib versus sorafenib (22.1 months [95% CI 19.1-27.2] vs 15.2 months [13.0-18.5]; HR 0.62 [95% CI 0.49-0.80]; one-sided p<0.0001). The most common grade 3 or 4 treatment-related adverse events were hypertension (102 [38%] of 272 patients in the camrelizumab-rivoceranib group vs 40 [15%] of 269 patients in the sorafenib group), palmar-plantar erythrodysaesthesia syndrome (33 [12%] vs 41 [15%]), increased aspartate aminotransferase (45 [17%] vs 14 [5%]), and increased alanine aminotransferase (35 [13%] vs eight [3%]). Treatment-related serious adverse events were reported in 66 (24%) patients in the camrelizumab-rivoceranib group and 16 (6%) in the sorafenib group. Treatment-related death occurred in two patients: one patient in the camrelizumab-rivoceranib group (ie, multiple organ dysfunction syndrome) and one patient in the sorafenib group (ie, respiratory failure and circulatory collapse). INTERPRETATION: Camrelizumab plus rivoceranib showed a statistically significant and clinically meaningful benefit in progression-free survival and overall survival compared with sorafenib for patients with unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma, presenting as a new and effective first-line treatment option for this population.

SETTING: The study was conducted in tertiary care centres in China. PARTICIPANTS: The study included advanced HCC patients enrolled in the FOHAIC-1 trial. Inclusion criteria followed the trial protocols, with patients stratified by disease severity (including the presence of Vp4 portal vein tumour thrombus (PVTT) and high tumour burden). INTERVENTIONS: HAIC-FO (fluorouracil, leucovorin and oxaliplatin) was compared with sorafenib for cost and health outcomes. PRIMARY OUTCOME MEASURE: The primary outcome was the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER), calculated as the additional cost per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained. RESULTS: Sorafenib yielded 0.66 QALYs at a cost of $15 011.73, whereas HAIC-FO yielded 1.00 QALY at a cost of $18 470.98. The ICER of HAIC-FO compared with sorafenib was $10 235.56 per QALY, which was below the willingness-to-pay (WTP) threshold of $30 492.00 per QALY. Sensitivity analyses confirmed that HAIC-FO remained cost-effective across variable assumptions, with probabilistic sensitivity analysis showing a 99.9% probability of cost-effectiveness at the WTP threshold. Subgroup analyses demonstrated more favourable ICERs for patients with Vp4 PVTT ($7003.33 per QALY) and those with high tumour burden ($7382.86 per QALY). CONCLUSIONS: HAIC-FO is a more cost-effective treatment for advanced HCC than sorafenib from the Chinese payer's perspective, particularly in patients with Vp4 PVTT and/or high tumour burden. Further research is needed to explore long-term economic implications and real-world effectiveness data. TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: NCT03164382.",0.5477767186554845

METHODS: Patients were randomly allocated to the CBATO-TACE group and the conventional transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (cTACE) group. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS). The secondary endpoint was overall survival (OS), treatment response, and treatment-related adverse events (TRAEs). The extrahepatic collateral arteries, liver function, and liver fibrosis after the first TACE were also evaluated. RESULTS: From September 2018 to September 2020, a total of 207 patients who underwent TACE were consecutively enrolled in this study. The median PFS was 9.5 months (range: 8.0 - 11.0) in the CBATO group, which was significantly longer than that in the cTACE group (6.0 months, range: 4.0-6.0) (p < 0.0001). Patients in the CBATO group had a median OS of 22 months (range: 20.0 - 27.0) compared with 16 months (range: 15.0 - 20.0) in the cTACE group (p = 0.0084). The most common TRAEs were fever (p = 0.043), and nausea and vomiting (p = 0.002), which were more observed in the cTACE group. In addition, the progressive disease time, pulmonary metastasis rate (p = 0.01), the mean number of extrahepatic collateral arteries (p = 0.01), and average number of TACE sessions (p = 0.025) were significantly decreased in the CBATO group. CONCLUSIONS: CBATO-TACE achieved better therapeutic outcomes and similar safety profile compared to cTACE in large or huge HCC patients. Furthermore, CBATO-TACE was able to reduce extrahepatic collateral arteries production and extrahepatic lung metastasis. CLINICAL RELEVANCE STATEMENT: Our study showed that CalliSpheres(R) beads loaded with arsenic trioxide (CBATO-TACE) were effective and safe for the treatment of large and giant HCC. In addition, CBATO-TACE can reduce lateral hepatic branch artery formation and extrahepatic pulmonary metastasis, which provides a new treatment approach for unresectable HCC. KEY POINTS: * We compare long-term efficacy and safety of transcatheter arterial chemoembolization with CalliSpheres(R) beads loaded with arsenic trioxide (CBATO-TACE) and conventional transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (cTACE) in patients with large (5 cm </= maximum diameter < 10 cm) or huge HCC (maximum diameter >/= 10 cm). * Compared with cTACE, CBATO-TACE significantly improved therapeutic outcomes, overall survival, and progression-free survival in patients with large or huge HCC. The safety assessment suggested that CBATO-TACE is a safe treatment that improves the quality of life and has good treatment adherence.",0.5475429696906798

In this phase 3 HEPATORCH study, we aimed to compare the efficacy and safety of toripalimab plus bevacizumab versus sorafenib in patients with previously untreated advanced hepatocellular carcinoma. METHODS: We did a randomised, open-label, phase 3 study in 57 hospitals across mainland China, Taiwan, and Singapore. Using a central interactive web response system, eligible patients aged 18-75 years with unresectable or metastatic hepatocellular carcinoma were randomly assigned (1:1) through a stratified block randomisation method to receive 240 mg toripalimab (intravenously, once every 3 weeks) plus 15 mg/kg bevacizumab (intravenously, once every 3 weeks) or 400 mg sorafenib (oral, twice daily). Randomisation was stratified by macrovascular invasion or extrahepatic spread (presence vs absence), ECOG performance status score (0 vs 1), and history of locoregional therapy (yes vs no). The co-primary endpoints were progression-free survival (assessed by the Independent Review Committee per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors, version 1.1) and overall survival. Efficacy analysis was performed in the intention-to-treat population (ie, all patients randomly assigned to a treatment group). Safety was assessed in all patients who received at least one dose of study treatment. The study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04723004, and is completed. FINDINGS: Between Nov 23, 2020, and Jan 21, 2022, 545 patients were screened for study inclusion, of whom 219 did not meet the screening criteria. 326 patients were randomly assigned to receive an intervention: 162 patients were assigned to the toripalimab plus bevacizumab group and 164 were assigned to the sorafenib group, with median age 58.0 years (IQR 50.0-66.0) and 56.0 years (49.0-61.0) years, respectively. All 326 patients were included in the intention-to-treat population and the safety population. 282 (87%) patients were male and 44 (14%) were female. At the primary analysis of progression-free survival (data cutoff Aug 10, 2022), median follow-up was 9.4 months (IQR 7.0-12.0). Toripalimab plus bevacizumab significantly prolonged progression-free survival compared with sorafenib (median 5.8 months [95% CI 4.6-7.2] vs 4.0 months [2.8-4.2]; hazard ratio [HR] 0.69 [95% CI 0.53-0.91; p=0.0086). At the final analysis of overall survival (May 31, 2024), median follow-up was 16.4 months (IQR 7.1-29.5). Toripalimab plus bevacizumab significantly improved overall survival compared with sorafenib (median 20.0 months [95% CI 15.3-23.4] vs 14.5 months [11.4-18.8]; HR 0.76 [95% CI 0.58-0.99; p=0.039). Grade 3 or higher adverse events occurred in 102 (63%) patients in the toripalimab plus bevacizumab group compared with 100 (61%) in the sorafenib group, and led to discontinuation of treatment in 21 (13.0%) participants in the toripalimab plus bevacizumab group and 20 (12%) participants in the sorafenib group. The incidence of treatment-related fatal adverse events (two [1%] vs one [1%]) was similar between the toripalimab plus bevacizumab and sorafenib groups. The most common (incidence >/=5% in the toripalimab plus bevacizumab group) grade 3-4 adverse events were hypertension (26 [16%] in the toripalimab plus bevacizumab group vs 19 [12%] in the sorafenib group), thrombocytopenia (16 [10%] vs four [2%]), upper gastrointestinal haemorrhage (ten [6%] vs one [1%]), anaemia (nine [6%] vs seven [4%]), and abnormal hepatic function (nine [6%] vs five [3%]). The most common (incidence >/=2% in the toripalimab plus bevacizumab group) serious adverse events were upper gastrointestinal haemorrhage (12 [7%] vs one [1%]), abnormal hepatic function (eight [5%] vs five [3%]), ascites (six [4%] vs three [2%]), and gastrointestinal haemorrhage (four [2%] vs three [2%]). INTERPRETATION: Among patients with previously untreated advanced hepatocellular carcinoma, toripalimab plus bevacizumab resulted in significantly longer progression-free survival and overall survival than did sorafenib, with an acceptable safety profile. Based on these results, the regimen has been approved for use in China by the National Medical Products Administration. FUNDING: Shanghai Junshi Biosciences.

We present updated data after 12 months of additional follow-up. METHODS: Patients with systemic treatment-naive, unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma were randomized 2:1 to receive 1,200 mg atezolizumab plus 15 mg/kg bevacizumab intravenously every 3 weeks or 400 mg sorafenib orally twice daily in this open-label, phase III study. Co-primary endpoints were OS and PFS by independently assessed RECIST 1.1 in the intention-to-treat population. Secondary efficacy endpoints included objective response rates and exploratory subgroup efficacy analyses. This is a post hoc updated analysis of efficacy and safety. RESULTS: From March 15, 2018, to January 30, 2019, 501 patients (intention-to-treat population) were randomly allocated to receive atezolizumab plus bevacizumab (n = 336) or sorafenib (n = 165). On August 31, 2020, after a median 15.6 (range, 0-28.6) months of follow-up, the median OS was 19.2 months (95% CI 17.0-23.7) with atezolizumab plus bevacizumab and 13.4 months (95% CI 11.4-16.9) with sorafenib (hazard ratio [HR] 0.66; 95% CI 0.52-0.85; descriptive p <0.001). The median PFS was 6.9 (95% CI 5.7-8.6) and 4.3 (95% CI 4.0-5.6) months in the respective treatment groups (HR 0.65; 95% CI 0.53-0.81; descriptive p < 0.001). Treatment-related grade 3/4 adverse events occurred in 143 (43%) of 329 and 72 (46%) of 156 safety-evaluable patients in the respective groups, and treatment-related grade 5 events occurred in 6 (2%) and 1 (<1%) patients. CONCLUSION: After longer follow-up, atezolizumab plus bevacizumab maintained clinically meaningful survival benefits over sorafenib and had a safety profile consistent with the primary analysis. GOV IDENTIFIER: NCT03434379. LAY SUMMARY: The primary analysis of IMbrave150 showed that atezolizumab plus bevacizumab had significantly greater benefits than sorafenib in patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma, but survival data were not yet mature. At this updated analysis done 12 months later, median overall survival was 5.8 months longer with atezolizumab plus bevacizumab than sorafenib, and the severity profile of treatment-related side effects remained similar. These updated results confirm atezolizumab plus bevacizumab as the first-line standard of care for advanced hepatocellular carcinoma.",0.5465676589970223

METHODS: This study was a multicenter, randomized, open-label, prospective, phase III trial. Patients with unresectable HCC were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive either TACE-apatinib or TACE-alone treatment. Patients in the TACE-apatinib group began with a dosage of 500 mg/day of oral apatinib administered 4 days after the first TACE. The primary endpoint of this study was progression-free survival (PFS). The secondary endpoints included overall survival (OS), objective response rate (ORR), disease control rate (DCR), time to untreatable (unTACEable) progression (TTUP), and safety assessment. RESULTS: From November 1, 2018 to November 18, 2021, a total of 196 patients were randomly assigned to either the TACE-apatinib (n = 86) or TACE-alone (n = 92) group. The median PFS in the TACE-apatinib group was significantly longer than that of in the TACE-alone group (6.1 months vs. 3.4 months, p < 0.0001). The median OS was significantly prolonged in the TACE-apatinib group compared to the TACE-alone group (28.9 months vs. 24.0 months, p = 0.0005). The median TTUP in the TACE-apatinib group was 26.8 months, which was significantly longer than that of 20.1 months in the TACE-alone group (p = 0.0003). A significantly higher ORR and DCR were observed in the TACE-apatinib group compared to the TACE-alone group (ORR: 58.1% vs. 31.5%, p < 0.001; DCR: 87.2% vs. 69.6%, p = 0.004). Most of the treatment-related adverse events were grades 1-2, and no treatment-related deaths were observed. CONCLUSIONS: Apatinib significantly improved the treatment effects of TACE for patients with unresectable HCC. TACE-apatinib could serve as a promising treatment option for this patient population, offering notable survival benefits while maintaining an acceptable safety profile.

METHODS: We conducted a computerized search of six electronic databases to identify studies pertinent to the combination of TACE and camrelizumab for treating advanced HCC. For further analysis of clinical indicators and adverse events data, we utilized random or fixed-effect models to account for heterogeneity between studies. RESULTS: As of May 30, 2023, 12 articles were included for Meta-analysis, encompassing 1123 patients with advanced HCC. The results indicated that the combined objective response rate (ORR) and disease control rate (DCR) were 51.1 % and 86.8 %, respectively. Regarding survival indicators, the combined overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) were 24.26 months and 11.84 months, respectively. Among the adverse events observed, the highest incidence rates for TACE combined with camrelizumab were fever (all grade: 46.5 %, >/=grade III: 5.0 %), hypertension (all grade: 32.2 %, >/=grade III: 8.5 %), transaminase elevation (all grade: 34.7 %, >/=grade III: 13.4 %), and nausea and vomiting (all grade: 43.9 %, >/=grade III: 2.5 %). CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrated the efficacy and safety of combining TACE with camrelizumab in treating patients with advanced HCC, providing valuable evidence for its prospective clinical application. However, due to the limited availability of clinical data, it is essential to design larger-scale and multi-center clinical randomized controlled trials in the future to validate and confirm these findings definitively.",0.5463748964218623

The combination of molecular targeted therapies and immunotherapy has shown promise in improving outcomes for advanced HCC. OBJECTIVE: This meta-analysis aims to assess the efficacy of combining transarterial chemoembolisation (TACE) with immune-targeted therapies in patients with unresectable HCC. METHODS: A systematic review and meta-analysis conforming to PRISMA guidelines were conducted by searching PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, and the Cochrane Library for studies published up to January 5, 2025. Due to the limited clinical evidence, our study exclusively included retrospective studies based on propensity score matching (PSM) analysis that compared the efficacy of TACE in combination with immune-targeted therapy to immune-targeted therapy alone. Key outcomes assessed included objective response rate (ORR), disease control rate (DCR), one-year overall survival (1-OS), one-year progression-free survival (1-PFS), median overall survival (mOS), and median progression-free survival (mPFS). RESULTS: A total of 9 PSM studies involving 2119 patients were included. The meta-analysis revealed that TACE significantly improved ORR, DCR, 1-OS, and 1-PFS, in addition to extending mOS and mPFS. CONCLUSION: The findings suggest that the inclusion of TACE in treatment regimens for unresectable HCC notably enhances tumour control and patient survival. This study provides moderate to high-quality evidence supporting the integration of TACE in advanced HCC management, particularly for those patients not meeting standard TACE criteria.

OBJECTIVE: To determine whether stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) improves outcomes in patients with locally advanced HCC compared with sorafenib alone. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This multicenter phase 3 randomized clinical trial randomized patients with HCC 1:1 to sorafenib or SBRT followed by sorafenib, stratified by performance status, liver function, degree of metastases, and macrovascular invasion. Eligible patients had HCC unsuitable for or refractory to standard local-regional therapies and were candidates for first-line systemic therapy. Data were collected from April 2013 to March 2021, and data were analyzed from July 2022 to August 2023. INTERVENTION: Personalized SBRT, 27.5 to 50 Gy in 5 fractions. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary end point was overall survival (OS). Secondary end points were progression-free survival (PFS), adverse events, and quality of life. RESULTS: Of 193 patients randomized, 177 were eligible. Accrual was stopped early due to a change in standard-of-care systemic therapy. Of 177 included patients, 150 (84.7%) were male, and the median (IQR) age was 66 (60-72) years. Macrovascular invasion was seen in 131 (74.0%). As of July 1, 2022, the median OS was 12.3 months (90% CI, 10.6-14.3) with sorafenib vs 15.8 months (90% CI, 11.4-19.2) following SBRT and sorafenib (hazard ratio [HR], 0.77; 90% CI, 0.59-1.01; 1-sided P = .06). Adjusting for stratification factors, OS was improved with SBRT (HR, 0.72; 95% CI, 0.52-0.99; 2-sided P = .04). Median PFS was improved from 5.5 months (95% CI, 3.4-6.3) with sorafenib to 9.2 months (95% CI, 7.5-11.9) with SBRT and sorafenib (HR, 0.55; 95% CI, 0.40-0.75; 2-sided P < .001). Treatment-related grade 3 or higher adverse events were seen in 37 of 88 (42%) and 39 of 83 (47%) of patients treated with sorafenib vs SBRT and sorafenib, respectively (P = .52). There were 2 treatment-related deaths in the sorafenib group (death not otherwise specified and liver failure) and 1 in the SBRT and sorafenib group (lung infection). At 6 months, improved quality of life was seen in 2 of 20 (10%) and 6 of 17 (35%) of patients treated with sorafenib and SBRT and sorafenib, respectively. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this phase 3 randomized clinical trial, among patients with locally advanced HCC, SBRT was associated with a clinically important but not statistically significant improved overall survival compared with sorafenib alone.

In unresectable HCC patients, transcatheter arterial (chemo-) embolization (TAE/TACE) has shown a disease response in 15-55% of cases. Though multiple TAE/TACE courses can be administered in principle, Stereotactic Body Radiotherapy (SBRT) has emerged as an alternative option in the case of local relapse following multiple TAE/TACE courses. Methods: This is a single-center, prospective, randomized, controlled, parallel-group superiority trial of SBRT versus standard TAE/TACE for the curative treatment of the intermediate stage of HCC after an incomplete response following TAE/TACE (NCT02323360). The primary endpoint is 1-year local control (LC): 18 events were needed to assess a 45% difference (HR: 0.18) in favor of SBRT. The secondary endpoints are 1-year Progression-Free Survival (PFS), Distant Recurrence-Free Survival (DRFS), Overall Survival (OS) and the incidence of acute and late complications. Results: At the time of the final analysis, 40 patients were enrolled, 19 (49%) in the TAE/TACE arm and 21 (51%) in the SBRT arm. The trial was prematurely closed due to slow accrual. The 1- and 2-year LC rates were 57% and 36%. The use of SBRT resulted in superior LC as compared to TAE/TACE rechallenge (median not reached versus 8 months, p = 0.0002). PFS was 29% and 16% at 1 and 2 years, respectively. OS was 86% and 62% at 1 year and 2 years, respectively. In the TAE arm, PFS was 13% and 6% at 1 and 2 years, respectively. In the SBRT arm, at 1 and 2 years, PFS was 37% and 21%, respectively. OS at 1 and 2 years was 75% and 64% in the SBRT arm and 95% and 57% in the TACE arm, respectively. No grade >3 toxicity was recorded. Conclusions: SBRT is an effective treatment option in patients affected by inoperable HCC experiencing an incomplete response following >/=1 cycle of TAE/TAC.",0.544346608932355

This treatment approach is more costly and effective than other therapeutic interventions, significantly improving AHCC survival and health-related quality of life. AIM: This economic study aimed to systematically review all cost-effectiveness analyses of ATZ/BVC combination in AHCC. METHOD: A comprehensive search in scientific databases was performed using a highly sensitive syntax to find all related economic evaluations. The target population was AHCC patients. The intervention was ATZ/BVC, which was compared with sorafenib, nivolumab, and other anticancer strategies. We included studies that reported quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) and/or life-years, costs, and incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER), and finally, the characteristics of included studies were categorized. RESULTS: Out of 315 identified records, 12 cost-effectiveness analyses were eligible for inclusion in the systematic review. Treatment costs were significantly higher with ATZ/BVC in all studies (from 61,397 to 253,687 USD/patient compared to sorafenib and nivolumab, respectively). Incremental QALYs/patient varied from 0.35 to 0.86 compared to sintilimab/BVC and sorafenib. Although ICERs for drugs varied widely, all were united in the lack of cost-effectiveness of the ATZ/BVC. The willingness-to-pay threshold in all studies was lower than the ICER, which indicated a reluctance to pay for this treatment strategy by the health systems. CONCLUSION: The ATZ/BVC combination is an expensive targeted immunotherapy in AHCC. Significant discounts in ATZ and BVC prices are essential for this novel approach to be cost-effective and extensively used.",0.5437105571084493

The authors systematically reviewed the literature on radiotherapy for spine metastatic HCCs. METHODS: The PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, and Cochrane databases were searched according to the PRISMA guidelines to include studies of radiotherapy for spine metastatic HCCs. Outcomes, complications, and local control were analyzed with indirect random-effect meta-analyses. RESULTS: The authors included 12 studies comprising 713 patients. The median time interval from diagnosis of HCC to spine metastases was 12 months (range 0-105 months). Most lesions were thoracic (35.9%) or lumbar (24.7%). Radiotherapy was delivered with conventional external-beam (67.3%) or stereotactic (31.7%) techniques. The median dose was 30.3 Gy (range 12.5-52 Gy) in a median of 5 fractions (range 1-20 fractions). The median biologically effective dose was 44.8 Gy10 (range 14.4-112.5 Gy10). Actuarial rates of postradiotherapy pain relief and radiological response were 87% (95% CI 84%-90%) and 70% (95% CI 65%-75%), respectively. Radiation-related adverse events and vertebral fractures had actuarial rates of 8% (95% CI 5%-11%) and 16% (95% CI 10%-23%), respectively, with fracture rates significantly higher after stereotactic radiotherapy (p = 0.033). Fifty-eight patients (27.6%) had local recurrences after a median of 6.8 months (range 0.1-59 months), with pooled local control rates of 61.6% at 6 months and 40.8% at 12 months, and there were no significant differences based on radiotherapy type (p = 0.068).

The approach combining systemic therapy and HAIC is likely to establish a new survival benchmark for advanced HCC. However, related evidence is still lacking. METHOD: PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, and Web of Science were searched from January 1990 to July 2024. The extracted data were pooled using fixed- or random-effects models and expressed as hazard ratios (HRs) or risk ratios (RRs) with corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Meta-regression, subgroup analysis, prognostic factor analysis, correlation analysis, as well as trial sequential analysis were further conducted. RESULT: Seventeen trials involving 3070 participants were included. Patients receiving HAIC combined systemic therapy displayed superior overall survival (OS) (HR, 0.52; 95% CI, 0.48-0.58), progression-free survival (PFS) (HR, 0.54; 95% CI, 0.46-0.63), objective response rate (ORR) (RR, 2.20; 95% CI, 1.77-2.72) and disease control rate (RR, 1.21; 95% CI, 1.14-1.29) over systemic therapy. Combining HAIC resulted in higher incidences of grade >/=3 manageable adverse events. Subgroup analyses showed that HAIC could bring significant survival improvement for almost all specific populations; however, patients without portal vein tumor thrombosis might not benefit from it (HR, 0.74; 95% CI, 0.53-1.03). Prognostic factor analyses found extra HAIC was a protective factor for both OS (HR, 0.42; 95% CI, 0.34-0.51) and PFS (HR, 0.44; 95% CI, 0.36-0.53). Correlation analyses demonstrated a robust association between ORR and OS when applying systemic therapy with HAIC ( P -value = 0.031). In addition, trial sequential analyses visually showed the present data were compelling to draw reliable conclusions. CONCLUSION: With manageable toxicity, integrating HAIC with systemic therapy could bring favorable survival benefits for HCC patients. Further evidence is necessary to standardize the integration of HAIC with first-line systemic therapy.",0.5435717224146837

In this study, the cost effectiveness of these treatments was assessed in the United States. METHODS: A cost-effectiveness analysis integrating a network meta-analysis framework was performed using data from the IMbrave150 (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier NCT03434379) and CheckMate 459 (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier NCT02576509) trials. In total, 1244 patients were enrolled. A partitioned survival model was used to evaluate cost effectiveness. A deterministic one-way sensitivity analysis and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were further performed to evaluate model robustness. Subgroup analyses were also performed. RESULTS: Compared with the outcomes using nivolumab, the hazard ratio (HR) for overall survival with atezo-beva was 0.68 (95% CI, 0.48-0.98), and the HR for progression-free survival was 0.63 (95% CI, 0.47-0.85). Atezo-beva treatment was associated with an increase of 1.13 life-years and an increase of 0.69 quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), as well as a $78,280 increase in cost per patient. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was $113,892 per QALY. The incremental net health benefit and the incremental net monetary benefit were 0.17 QALYs and $24,770, respectively, at a willingness-to-pay (WTP) threshold of $150,000 per QALY. The model was most sensitive to the HR for progression-free survival. The probability of atezo-beva being considered cost effective was 78%, and it was >50% in most of the subgroups at the WTP threshold of $150,000 per QALY.

This study aims to employ a rigorous network meta-analysis (NMA) approach to systematically evaluate the effectiveness of immune-combination therapies among patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma, taking into account their varying clinico-characteristics. METHODS: Studies were retrieved from PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, and Web of Science databases. The included first-line phase III studies were categorized into three types: immunotherapy combined with anti-angiogenetic agents, immunotherapy combined with tyrosine kinase inhibitors, and dual immunotherapy, with sorafenib serving as the control group. The primary endpoint used to assess efficacy was overall survival (OS), facilitating a comparative analysis among the three treatment modalities. Furthermore, subgroup analyses were conducted to evaluate the varying effectiveness for patients with diverse clinico-characteristics. Secondary outcome measures included progression-free survival, objective response rate, and toxicity assessment. RESULTS: A total of 6 studies were included in the NMA, encompassing a cohort of 3840 patients. The results revealed that immunotherapy combined with anti-angiogenetic agents exhibited a significantly enhanced therapeutic effect in terms of improving OS compared to sorafenib (HR = 0.61, 95% CrI, 0.42-0.90). Furthermore, based on various clinicopathological features, this combination therapy demonstrated superior OS responses in specific patient subgroups: BCLC C (HR = 0.63, 95% CrI, 0.42-0.93), ECOG 1 (HR = 0.57, 95% CrI, 0.36-0.91), with extrahepatic spread (EHS) (HR = 0.59, 95% CrI, 0.37-0.92), alpha fetoprotein (AFP)<400ng/ml (HR = 0.56, 95% CrI, 0.33-0.94) and viral hepatitis positivity (HR = 0.56, 95% CrI, 0.39-0.77) (especially HBV (HR = 0.58, 95% CrI, 0.40-0.85)). Importantly, the advantage of this combination therapy was even more pronounced in patients with viral hepatitis positivity. Also, the adverse events associated with immunotherapy combined with antiangiogenic drugs were moderate. CONCLUSIONS: Immunotherapy combined with anti-angiogenetic agents could represent the most effective first-line intervention for achieving improved OS, particularly in patients with viral hepatitis positivity.",0.5398938474317537

This systematic review aims to explore TACE's efficacy and safety in these cases. METHODS: A literature search was conducted on TACE in HCC patients with vascular invasion or extrahepatic metastasis. The study compared TACE with surgical resection/chemotherapeutic drugs or with no group as well. Safety was assessed for adverse outcomes and efficacy, including overall survival, mean survival, and progression-free survival (PFS). Data extraction included study characteristics, patient demographics, intervention details, outcomes, and adverse events. RESULTS: A study of 28 studies involving 3740 patients found that TACE showed diverse safety and efficacy outcomes. Safety evaluations focused on liver function tests, while patient-reported symptoms included fever, pain, vomiting, and gastrointestinal issues. Overall survival was under 10 months in 9 studies, with PFS lower in the TACE group compared to conservative treatments. Survival rates ranged from 93.4% at 3 months to 13% at 24 months across studies. The study identified potential subsets where TACE exhibited efficacy, especially in cases with favorable liver function or specific tumor classifications.

Prospective uncontrolled studies suggest that yttrium 90 ((90)Y) transarterial radioembolization (TARE) is a safe and effective alternative. Purpose To compare the efficacy and safety of TARE with TACE for unresectable HCC. Materials and Methods In this single-center prospective randomized controlled trial (TRACE), (90)Y glass TARE was compared with doxorubicin drug-eluting bead (DEB) TACE in participants with intermediate-stage HCC, extended to Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status 1 and those with early-stage HCC not eligible for surgery or thermoablation. Participants were recruited between September 2011 and March 2018. The primary end point was time to overall tumor progression (TTP) (Kaplan-Meier analysis) in the intention-to-treat (ITT) and per-protocol (PP) groups. Results At interim analysis, 38 participants (median age, 67 years; IQR, 63-72 years; 33 men) were randomized to the TARE arm and 34 (median age, 68 years; IQR, 61-71 years; 30 men) to the DEB-TACE arm (ITT group). Median TTP was 17.1 months in the TARE arm versus 9.5 months in the DEB-TACE arm (ITT group hazard ratio [HR], 0.36; 95% CI: 0.18, 0.70; P = .002) (PP group, 32 and 34 participants, respectively, in each arm; HR, 0.29; 95% CI: 0.14, 0.60; P < .001). Median overall survival was 30.2 months after TARE and 15.6 months after DEB-TACE (ITT group HR, 0.48; 95% CI: 0.28, 0.82; P = .006). Serious adverse events grade 3 or higher (13 of 33 participants [39%] vs 19 of 36 [53%] after TARE and DEB-TACE, respectively; P = .47) and 30-day mortality (0 of 33 participants [0%] vs three of 36 [8.3%]; P = .24) were similar in the safety groups. At the interim, the HR for the primary end point, TTP, was less than 0.39, meeting the criteria to halt the study. Conclusion With similar safety profile, yttrium 90 radioembolization conferred superior tumor control and survival compared with chemoembolization using drug-eluting beads in selected participants with early or intermediate hepatocellular carcinoma.

This study aimed to review the latest evidence regarding FL-HCC treatment and prognosis. METHODS: A systematic review of the literature over the past 10 years regarding FL-HCC, and meta-analysis of 1-, 3-, and 5-year overall survival (OS) comparing FL-HCC and conventional HCC were performed. RESULTS: Overall, 1567 articles were screened, of them 21 were selected for the systematic review, and 6 for meta-analysis. Twenty-one studies included a total of 2168 patients with FL-HCC, with a median age ranging from 11 to 56 years. The majority of patients underwent surgical resection or liver transplantation. After a median follow-up ranging from 24 to 58 months, 1-year OS was 67-100% and 5-year OS was 28-65%. A total of 743 patients with FL-HCC and 163,472 with conventional HCC were included in the meta-analysis. There was a significantly improved 1-, 3-, and 5-years OS in the FL-HCC group compared to the conventional HCC group, although high heterogeneity was found. When excluding population-based studies, and including 96 FL-HCC and 221 conventional HCC patients, the heterogeneity was low, and the meta-analysis showed a significantly longer 1-year OS in patients with FL-HCC than conventional HCC; however, there were no differences at 3- and 5-years OS. CONCLUSIONS: Surgical resection for FL-HCC is currently the only curative treatment available. FL-HCC is plagued by high-recurrence rates and poor long-term outcomes which may be related to the absence of specific treatment for advanced and recurrent disease.",0.539085757746153

METHODS: We systematically searched PubMed, the Web of Science, the Cochrane Library, and Embase for studies comparing TACE + T + I and TACE + T for the treatment of BCLC intermediate- or advanced-stage HCC. The objective response rate (ORR), progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), and AEs were included as outcomes. We used a fixed- or random-effects model based on the results of a heterogeneity evaluation and performed a meta-analysis using Review Manager 5.3 and Stata 16.0. We then carried out the TSA. RESULTS: Five studies examining a total of 425 patients were included in this study. Our meta-analysis revealed that, compared to TACE + T, TACE + T + I significantly improved the ORR (risk ratio [RR] = 1.53, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.27-1.85, p < 0.01) and extended both the median PFS (mean difference [MD] = 4.51 months, 95% CI = 2.16-6.87, p < 0.01) and median OS (MD = 5.75 months, 95% CI = 4.03-7.48, p < 0.01). These results were tested to be true by the TSA without requiring a larger information size. Among AEs, hypertension tended to occur more often in patients treated with TACE + T + I than in those treated with TACE + T (RR = 1.58, 95% CI = 1.05-2.40, p < 0.05). However, the TSA suggested that additional cases are necessary to confirm this difference. Regarding the other AEs, no significant differences were detected between the two groups. CONCLUSION: TACE + T + I showed better effects on the ORR, PFS, and OS than TACE + T as a treatment for BCLC stages B and C HCC, without an obvious increase in the AEs.

Most patients are diagnosed at advanced stages, with a 5-year survival rate below 10%. Therefore, HCC treatment and research still face significant challenges, and more effective treatments need to be further explored. METHODS: We searched PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science and Embase from the time of repository construction to March 1, 2025, preliminary included studies involving animal experiments on the therapeutic effects of Chimeric Antigen Receptor T-cell (CAR-T cell) therapy on HCC. After exclusion and evaluation of literature, the random/fixed effects model was employed to perform meta-analysis and obtain Weighted Mean Difference (WMD) and 95% confidence interval (CI) of tumor volume and mass. We then verify the robustness of the results through subgroup analysis and sensitivity analysis. Use Q-test to evaluate heterogeneity and quantify it based on I(2) value. RESULTS: We included a total of 16 studies. Multiple independent sets of data were extracted from the experiments of these studies, of which 25 were used for volume-based meta-analysis and 16 were used for mass-based meta-analysis. Regarding volume, The combined mean CAR-T treatment group/control group resulted in an WMD of -515.77 (95% CI: -634.78 to -396.76; I(2) =90.8%). Meanwhile, based on mass, the combined mean CAR-T treatment group/control group resulted in an WMD of -0.30 (95% CI: -0.38 to -0.22; I(2) = 94.4%). The results of the bias analysis further validated the reliability of the research conclusions. CONCLUSIONS: Based on the dual-index meta-analysis, the CAR-T therapy have been proved to possess significant therapeutic effect in HCC. However, the funnel plot of tumor mass and the Egger's regression suggest the potential presence of publication bias. Thus, it warrants further research to evaluate the potential of CAR-T therapy alone or as an adjuvant for HCC treatment.",0.5341335850218697

RESULTS: Cabozantinib improved OS and PFS versus placebo in both ALBI grade 1 (hazard ratio [HR] [95% CI]: 0.63 [0.46-0.86] and 0.42 [0.32-0.56]) and ALBI grade 2 (HR [95% CI]: 0.84 [0.66-1.06] and 0.46 [0.37-0.58]) subgroups. Adverse events were consistent with those in the overall population. Rates of grade 3/4 adverse events associated with hepatic decompensation were generally low and were more common among patients in the ALBI grade 2 subgroup. DISCUSSION: These results provide initial support of cabozantinib in patients with advanced HCC irrespective of ALBI grade 1 or 2.

The impact of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) on prognosis in uHCC patients treated with transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) and lenvatinib remains unclear. AIM: The purpose of this study was to compare the efficacy and safety of TACE plus lenvatinib plus ICIs (TACE+L+I) with TACE plus lenvatinib (TACE+L) in the treatment of patients with uHCC. METHODS: Publicly available studies comparing the efficacy and safety of TACE+L+I and TACE+L in the treatment of uHCC were collected from the databases PubMed, Embase and Cochrane Library, with a cut-off date of November 1, 2024. Stata SE 15 software was used for analysis. RESULTS: Fifteen studies with a total of 1365 patients were included, 688 in the TACE+L+I group and 677 in the TACE+L group. Meta-analysis showed that the TACE+L+I group was significantly higher than the TACE+L group in complete response (RR = 2.34, 95%CI:1.53, 3.59, p < 0.0001), partial response (RR = 1.45, 95%CI:1.28, 1.64, p < 0.0001), objective response rate (RR = 1.55, 95%CI:1.39, 1.73, p < 0.00001), and disease control rate (RR = 1.22, 95%CI:1.10, 1.36, p = 0.0003). The TACE+L+I group was significantly lower than the TACE+L group in progression of disease (RR = 0.39, 95%CI:0.30, 0.51, p < 0.00001). Moreover, TACE+L+I group was not significantly different from TACE+L group in stable disease (RR = 0.85, 95%CI:0.69, 1.03, p = 0.10). The TACE+L+I group was significantly higher than the TACE+L group in overall survival (HR = 2.32, 95%CI:1.95, 3.15, p<0.05) and progression-free survival (HR = 2.30, 95%CI:1.80, 2.93, p<0.05). The TACE+L+I group had a significantly higher incidence of hypothyroidism compared to the TACE+L group (RR = 1.81, 95%CI:1.20, 2.71, p<0.05), but there was no significant difference in other adverse events, such as hypertension, diarrhea, hand-foot syndrome, fatigue, elevated AST, elevated ALT, decreased appetite, hypothyroidism, abdominal pain, thrombocytopenia, rash, and nausea. CONCLUSION: ICIs significantly improved the survival outcome of uHCC treated with TACE+L, and increased the incidence of hypothyroidism. However, this conclusion still needs further validation in the future with more high-quality randomized controlled trials and longer follow-up.",0.5305569258019014

The ImmunoTACE trial evaluated the preliminary activity of this vaccine in combination with transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) in patients with intermediate-stage hepatocellular carcinoma. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A randomized phase II trial was conducted in three tertiary referral centers in the United Kingdom. Eligible patients were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to TACE + preconditioning cyclophosphamide or to TACE + preconditioning cyclophosphamide + DC infusions. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival time using RECIST v1.1 criteria. Additional endpoints included safety and immune responses. RESULTS: Between March 2016 and October 2019, 55 patients were randomized, of whom 48 were evaluable (24 in each group). The median progression-free survival time using RECIST criteria was 18.6 months in patients treated with chemoembolization + preconditioning cyclophosphamide + DC infusions compared with 10.4 months in those treated with chemoembolization + preconditioning cyclophosphamide alone (HR = 0.43; upper value of one-sided 80% confidence interval, 0.57; P = 0.016). The addition of DC infusions did not significantly increase the incidence or severity of adverse events. An enhanced antigen (alpha-fetoprotein)-specific immune response was observed in patients treated with DC vaccination. CONCLUSIONS: The addition of DC infusions to TACE and preconditioning cyclophosphamide has shown promising preliminary activity and merits further investigation in a larger randomized trial.",0.5303406952614015

The objective of this study was to conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis of prospective randomized clinical trials to assess the clinical efficacy of EBRT versus TACE for HCC as either a definitive monotherapy or as a bridge to transplantation/surgery. METHODS: A systematic review and meta-analysis were performed to include prospective randomized trials comparing EBRT versus TACE. Data was analyzed with random and fixed-effects models. The inconsistency index (I(2)) was chosen to assess heterogeneity. Three publications were included with a total of 142 patients. Outcomes included local control (LC), overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS), and occurrences of grade >/=3 toxicity. Comparisons are reported as hazard ratios (HRs) or risk ratios (RRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). RESULTS: There were three randomized trials that met inclusion criteria. The EBRT was delivered in three to 15 fractions with a total dose between 30 and 75 gray(Gy). EBRT was associated with significantly improved LC (HR, 0.16; 95% CI, 0.08-0.34; I(2) = 0%) and PFS (HR, 0.37; 95% CI, 0.23-0.60; I(2), 0%) compared with TACE.

This systematic review pioneers to evaluate the clinical efficacy and safety of transarterial chemo(embolization) combined with immune-targeted therapy for uHCC patients. METHODS: PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane Library were searched for studies comparing immune-targeted therapy with or without transarterial chemo(embolization) until 31 May 2024. The complete response (CR) rate, objective response rate (ORR), and disease control rate (DCR) were considered to be the primary outcomes calculated for the clinical outcomes of transarterial chemo(embolization) combined with immune-targeted therapy, along with progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS). The incidence of treatment-related severe adverse events was set as the major measure for the safety outcome. RESULTS: Sixteen studies, encompassing 1,789 patients receiving transarterial chemo(embolization) plus immune-targeted therapy and 1,215 patients receiving immune-targeted therapy alone, were considered eligible. The combination of transarterial chemo(embolization) and immune-targeted therapy demonstrated enhanced outcomes in CR (OR = 2.12, 95% CI = 1.35-3.31), ORR (OR = 2.78, 95% CI = 2.15-3.61), DCR (OR = 2.46, 95% CI = 1.72-3.52), PFS (HR = 0.59, 95% CI = 0.50-0.70), and OS (HR = 0.51, 95% CI = 0.44-0.59), albeit accompanied by a surge in ALT (OR = 2.17, 95% CI = 1.28-3.68) and AST (OR = 2.28, 95% CI = 1.42-3.65). The advantages of additional transarterial chemo(embolization) to immune-targeted therapy were also verified in subgroups of first-line treatment, intervention techniques, with or without extrahepatic metastasis, Child-Pugh grade A or B, and with or without tumor thrombus. CONCLUSION: The combination of transarterial chemo(embolization) and immune-targeted therapy seems to bolster local control and long-term efficacy in uHCC, albeit at the expense of hepatic complications.

Herein, we aimed to validate objective response as an independent predictor of OS in individuals with unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) receiving systemic anti-angiogenic therapy. METHODS: We investigated the association between objective response (investigator-assessed mRECIST, independent radiologic review [IRR] mRECIST and RECIST v1.1) and OS in REFLECT, a phase III study of lenvatinib vs. sorafenib. We conducted landmark analyses (Simon-Makuch) of OS by objective response at 2, 4, and 6 months after randomization. RESULTS: Median OS was 21.6 months (95% CI 18.6-24.5) for responders (investigator-assessed mRECIST) vs. 11.9 months (95% CI 10.7-12.8) for non-responders (hazard ratio [HR] 0.61; 95% CI 0.49-0.76; p <0.001). Objective response by IRR per mRECIST and RECIST v1.1 supported the association with OS (HR 0.61; 95% CI 0.51-0.72; p <0.001 and HR 0.50; 95% CI 0.39-0.65; p <0.001, respectively). OS was significantly prolonged for responders vs. non-responders (investigator-assessed mRECIST) at the 2-month (HR 0.61; 95% CI 0.49-0.76; p <0.001), 4-month (HR 0.63; 95% CI 0.51-0.80; p <0.001), and 6-month (HR 0.68; 95% CI 0.54-0.86; p <0.001) landmarks. Results were similar when assessed by IRR, with both mRECIST and RECIST v1.1. An exploratory multivariate Cox regression analysis identified objective response by investigator-assessed mRECIST (HR 0.55; 95% CI 0.44-0.68; p <0.0001) and IRR-assessed RECIST v1.1 (HR 0.49; 95% CI, 0.38-0.64; p <0.0001) as independent predictors of OS in individuals with unresectable HCC. CONCLUSIONS: Objective response was an independent predictor of OS in individuals with unresectable HCC in REFLECT; additional studies are needed to confirm surrogacy. Participants achieving a complete or partial response by mRECIST or RECIST v1.1 had significantly longer survival vs. those with stable/progressive/non-evaluable disease. GOV NUMBER: NCT01761266. IMPACT AND IMPLICATIONS: This analysis of data taken from a completed clinical trial (REFLECT) looked for any link between objective response and overall survival time in individuals with unresectable HCC receiving anti-angiogenic treatments. Significantly longer median overall survival was found for responders (21.6 months) vs. non-responders (11.9 months). Overall survival was also significantly longer for responders vs. non-responders (based on objective response status at 2, 4, and 6 months) in the landmark analysis. Our results indicate that objective response is an independent predictor of overall survival in this setting, confirming its validity as a rapid marker of efficacy that can be applied in phase II trials; however, further validation is required to determine is validity for other systemic treatments (e.g. immunotherapies), or as a surrogate of overall survival.",0.5252623780686784

METHODS: Thirty patients with HCC and 29 patients with ICC were randomly assigned to receive locoregional therapy (HCC, Group A, n = 15; ICC, Group C, n = 15) or locoregional therapy plus gammadelta T cell therapy (HCC, Group B, n = 15; ICC, Group D, n = 14). Groups A and C only received locoregional ablation (cryoablation or irreversible electroporation), whereas Groups B and D received locoregional therapy followed by adoptive transfer of allogeneic gammadelta T cells. The primary endpoints were safety, distant progression-free survival (PFS), local PFS, and overall survival (OS). RESULTS: The median distant PFS was significantly longer in the combined treatment groups than the locoregional treatment groups (HCC: 8 vs 4 months, P = .04; ICC: 8 vs 4 months, P = .021). There was no significant difference in local PFS between the 2 treatment modalities. Patients with HCC in the combined treatment group had a longer OS (median OS: 13 vs 8 months, P = .029). However, there was no significant difference in OS in patients with ICC between the 2 treatment modalities (median OS: 9.5 vs 8 months, P = .546).

However, there are variations in the efficacy and safety outcomes between TACE-T-I versus TACE combined with targeted drugs (TACE-T). This study aims to systematically evaluate the efficacy and safety of TACE-T-I versus TACE-T in unresectable HCC. METHODS: PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, and Web of Science databases were searched from inception to August 21, 2023, for comparative studies on TACE-T-I versus TACE-T for unresectable HCC. Outcome measures included overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS), objective response rate (ORR), disease control rate (DCR) and the incidence of treatment-related adverse events (TRAEs). OS was the primary outcome of this study. Weighted mean difference (WMD) or hazard ratio (HR) was used as the pooled statistic for OS and PFS. Relative risk (RR) was employed as the pooled statistic for ORR, DCR and the incidence of TRAEs. And 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated for all effect measures. Data analysis was conducted using Stata 14.0 software. RESULTS: The meta-analysis included 14 studies with 2144 patients. The pooled results showed that compared with patients in the TACE-T group, patients in the TACE-T-I group had higher ORR (RR = 1.61; 95%CI: 1.38-1.89) and DCR (RR = 1.17; 95%CI: 1.09-1.26). Patients in the TACE-T-I group experienced prolonged PFS (WMD = 3.08; 95%CI: 2.63-3.53) and OS (WMD = 5.76; 95%CI: 4.68-6.84). And the risk of disease progression (HR = 0.45; 95%CI: 0.37-0.55) and death (HR = 0.43; 95%CI: 0.38-0.49) was lower in the TACE-T-I group. Common TRAEs included fever, pain, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, elevated ALT, elevated AST, hypertension, hand-foot syndrome, proteinuria, and diarrhea. The incidence and severity of TRAEs in the TACE-T-I group were similar to those in the TACE-T group, with no significant differences (P > .05). CONCLUSION: Current evidence suggests that, on the basis of TACE combined with targeted therapy, the addition of immunotherapy provides better clinical efficacy and survival benefits for unresectable HCC patients, with good tolerability.",0.5234011407934407

Portal vein tumor thrombus (PVTT) is among the most ominous signs of advanced stage disease and has been associated with poor survival if untreated. DATA SOURCES: A systematic search of MEDLINE (PubMed), Embase, Cochrane Library and Database for Systematic Reviews (CDSR), Google Scholar, and National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) databases until December 2022 was conducted using free text and MeSH terms: hepatocellular carcinoma, portal vein tumor thrombus, portal vein thrombosis, vascular invasion, liver and/or hepatic resection, liver transplantation, and systematic review. RESULTS: Centers of surgical excellence have reported promising results related to the individualized surgical management of portal thrombus versus arterial chemoembolization or systemic chemotherapy. Critical elements to the individualized surgical management of HCC and portal thrombus include precise classification of the portal vein tumor thrombus, accurate identification of the subgroups of patients who may benefit from resection, as well as meticulous surgical technique. This review addressed five specific areas: (a) formation of PVTT; (b) classifications of PVTT; (c) controversies related to clinical guidelines; (d) surgical treatments versus non-surgical approaches; and (e) characterization of surgical techniques correlated with classifications of PVTT.

METHODS: A randomized controlled study was conducted from August 2016 to December 2019 on patients with unresectable HCC and PVTT. The patients were randomly assigned to RT + TACE group or TACE + RT group in a 1:1 ratio. Evaluation of therapeutic effects on the primary tumor was based on the modified Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (mRECIST), while that on PVTT was based on the changing of Cheng's PVTT classification. The primary end-point was overall survival (OS). RESULTS: The 120 patients who entered this study were evenly assigned to two groups. In the intention-to-treat (ITT) population, the OS rates for RT + TACE group at 1, 2 and 3 years were 61.7%, 27.4% and 15.6%, compared with 45.0%, 16.1% and 4.7% in TACE + RT group. The median OS was increased in patients with RT + TACE compared with those who had TACE + RT with a marginally significance (15.4 versus 11.5 months, HR = 0.68, 95% CI 0.46-1.01, p = 0.054).

Immunotherapy has been shown to improve survival in advanced hepatocellular carcinoma; we therefore aimed to evaluate the safety and tolerability of perioperative immunotherapy in resectable hepatocellular carcinoma. METHODS: In this single-centre, randomised, open-label, phase 2 trial, patients with resectable hepatocellular carcinoma were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive 240 mg of nivolumab intravenously every 2 weeks (for up to three doses before surgery at 6 weeks) followed in the adjuvant phase by 480 mg of nivolumab intravenously every 4 weeks for 2 years, or 240 mg of nivolumab intravenously every 2 weeks (for up to three doses before surgery) plus one dose of 1 mg/kg of ipilimumab intravenously concurrently with the first preoperative dose of nivolumab, followed in the adjuvant phase by 480 mg of nivolumab intravenously every 4 weeks for up to 2 years plus 1 mg/kg of ipilimumab intravenously every 6 weeks for up to four cycles. Patients were randomly assigned to the treatment groups by use of block randomisation with a random block size. The primary endpoint was the safety and tolerability of nivolumab with or without ipilimumab. Secondary endpoints were the proportion of patients with an overall response, time to progression, and progression-free survival. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT03222076) and is completed. FINDINGS: Between Oct 30, 2017, and Dec 3, 2019, 30 patients were enrolled and 27 were randomly assigned: 13 to nivolumab and 14 to nivolumab plus ipilimumab. Grade 3-4 adverse events were higher with nivolumab plus ipilimumab (six [43%] of 14 patients) than with nivolumab alone (three [23%] of 13). The most common treatment-related adverse events of any grade were increased alanine aminotransferase (three [23%] of 13 patients on nivolumab vs seven [50%] of 14 patients on nivolumab plus ipilimumab) and increased aspartate aminotransferase (three [23%] vs seven [50%]). No patients in either group had their surgery delayed due to grade 3 or worse adverse events. Seven of 27 patients had surgical cancellations, but none was due to treatment-related adverse events. Estimated median progression-free survival was 9.4 months (95% CI 1.47-not estimable [NE]) with nivolumab and 19.53 months (2.33-NE) with nivolumab plus ipilimumab (hazard ratio [HR] 0.99, 95% CI 0.31-2.54); median time to progression was 9.4 months (95% CI 1.47-NE) in the nivolumab group and 19.53 months (2.33-NE) in the nivolumab plus ipilimumab group (HR 0.89, 95% CI 0.31-2.54). In an exploratory analysis, three (23%) of 13 patients had an overall response with nivolumab monotherapy, versus none with nivolumab plus ipilimumab. Three (33%) of nine patients had a major pathological response (ie, >/=70% necrosis in the resected tumour area) with nivolumab monotherapy compared with three (27%) of 11 with nivolumab plus ipilimumab. INTERPRETATION: Perioperative nivolumab alone and nivolumab plus ipilimumab appears to be safe and feasible in patients with resectable hepatocellular carcinoma. Our findings support further studies of immunotherapy in the perioperative setting in hepatocellular carcinoma.

Therapies with different energy sources, such as radiofrequency ablation, microwave ablation, and cryoablation, employ different mechanisms to induce tumor necrosis. The precision, safety, and effectiveness of these therapies have increased with advances in guiding technologies and device improvements. Consequently, local ablation has become the first-line treatment for early-stage hepatocellular carcinoma. The lack of organized evidence and expert opinions regarding patient selection, preprocedure preparation, procedural methods, swift post-treatment evaluation, and follow-up has resulted in clinicians following varied practices.

Primary endpoints were progression-free survival (threshold one-sided p=0.025), per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumours version 1.1 (modified for the current study to allow for up to five target tumours in the liver and requiring new intrahepatic tumours to meet LI-RADS 5 criteria to be considered progressive disease) by blinded independent central review, and overall survival (threshold one-sided p=0.0012) in the intention-to-treat (ITT) population (ie, all participants randomly assigned to treatment). Safety was assessed in the as-treated population (ie, all participants who were randomly assigned and received at least one dose of any study treatment). Here, we report results from the first interim analysis (final analysis for progression-free survival). This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04246177, and is active but not recruiting. FINDINGS: Between May 22, 2020, and Jan 11, 2023, 847 patients were screened, of whom 480 (57%) were enrolled and randomly assigned to receive TACE plus lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab (n=237) or TACE plus dual placebo (n=243; ITT population). Median age was 66 years (IQR 58-73), 82 (17%) of 480 participants were female, 398 (83%) were male, 98 (20%) were White, 347 (72%) were Asian, four (1%) were Black or African American, and five (1%) were American Indian or Alaska Native. Median follow-up as of data cutoff (Jan 30, 2024) was 25.6 months (IQR 19.5-32.4). Median progression-free survival was 14.6 months (95% CI 12.6-16.7; 132 events [20 deaths and 112 progressions]) with lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab and 10.0 months (8.1-12.2; 154 events [eight deaths and 146 progressions]) with placebo (hazard ratio [HR] 0.66 [95% CI 0.51-0.84]; one-sided p=0.0002). 69 (29%) of 237 in the lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab group and 82 (34%) of 243 from the placebo group died, with a 24-month overall survival rate of 75% (95% CI 68-80) in the lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab group and 69% (62-74) in the placebo group (HR 0.80 [95% CI 0.57-1.11]; one-sided p=0.087). Grade 3 or worse treatment-related adverse events occurred in 169 (71%) of 237 participants in the lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab group and in 76 (32%) of 241 in the placebo group, the most common of which were hypertension (57 [24%] vs 18 [7%]) and platelet count decreased (27 [11%] vs 15 [6%]). Deaths due to treatment-related adverse events occurred in four (2%) participants in the lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab group (n=1 each due to hepatic failure, gastrointestinal haemorrhage, myositis, and immune-mediated hepatitis) and one (<1%) in the placebo group (due to brain stem haemorrhage). INTERPRETATION: TACE plus lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab showed significant, clinically meaningful improvement in progression-free survival in patients with unresectable, non-metastatic hepatocellular carcinoma compared with TACE plus placebo. The numerical improvement in overall survival is encouraging, but longer follow-up is necessary.

The benefits of the 2 treatments remain controversial. We conduct this meta-analysis to assess the efficacy and safety of the 2 methods for the patients with unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma. METHODS: In order to get a sound conclusion, we did thorough search all relevant studies with clear and stringent keyword criteria on the main databases. Objective tumor response rate, overall survival (OS) rate and adverse events were calculated and analyzed by RevMan 5.3 software. The random-effects or fixed-effects model was applied to pool the estimates according to Cochran Q test and I2 statistics. RESULTS: Twenty-four studies involving 2987 patients were eligible. DEB-TACE significantly improved objective tumor response rate (OR) (risk ratio [RR] = 1.27, 95% confidence interval [CI] [1.08, 1.48]; P = .003). While as for 1-year, 2-year, 3-year, 5-year OS rates, there were no evidences to indicate that DEB-TACE was significantly better than cTACE (RR = 1.05, 95% CI [0.99, 1.11]; P = .08), (RR = 1.02, 95% CI [0.93, 1.11]; P = .68), (RR = 0.92, 95% CI [0.77, 1.10]; P = .37), (RR = 0.92, 95% CI [0.47, 1.80]; P = .81), respectively. Adverse events rate (AE) was also similar in both groups (RR = 1.11, 95% CI [0.99,1.26]; P = .08). CONCLUSION: This meta-analysis demonstrates that DEB-TACE is not superior than cTACE regarding to OS and AE. However, DEB-TACE still be considered to provide a better objective tumor response rate for patients with unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma.",0.5164861331392394

Conventional transarterial chemoembolization (c-TACE) and drug-eluting beads transarterial chemoembolization (DEB-TACE) are two treatment options for ICC, and this systematic review describes the efficacy of each of these modalities for unresectable ICC to guide clinical practice. METHODS: A literature search was performed in PubMed, Web of Science, and Embase databases regarding transhepatic arterial chemoembolization for intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma. The Newcastle-Ottawa quality assessment Scale (NOS) was used to assess the risk of bias. Tumor response, disease control, and 1-, 2-, 3-year overall survival rate were pooled for estimation. RESULTS: The number of initial search results was 1035, and 19 articles met the inclusion criteria for this study after the screening. A total of 23 study cohorts and 1091 patients were provided. The pooled objective response rate (ORR) for c-TACE and DEB-TACE treating ICC was 29.4% (95% CI 11.6-50.8%) and 51.2% (95% CI 30.6-71.7%), respectively; disease control rate (DCR) was 72.8% (95% CI 55.6-87.3%) and 88.7% (95% CI 78.8-96.2%), respectively.

However, the standard of care in first-line treatment with atezolizumab (anti-PD-L1 therapy) in combination with bevacizumab is associated with a limited objective response rate. Telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT) activation meets the criteria of oncogenic addiction in HCC and could be actionable therapeutic target and a relevant tumor antigen. Therefore we hypothesized that combining anti-PD-1/PD-L1 therapy with an anti-telomerase vaccine might be an attractive therapy in HCC. UCPVax is a therapeutic cancer vaccine composed of two separate peptides derived from telomerase (human TERT). UCPVax has been evaluated in a multicenter phase I/II study in non-small cell lung cancers and has demonstrated to be safe and immunogenic, and is under evaluation in combination with atezolizumab in a phase II clinical trial in tumors where telomerase reactivation contributes to an oncogene addiction (HPV(+) cancers). The aim of the TERTIO study is to determine the clinical interest and immunological efficacy of a treatment combining the CD4 helper T-inducer cancer anti-telomerase vaccine (UCPVax) with atezolizumab and bevacizumab in unresectable HCC in a multicenter randomized phase II study. METHODS: Patients with locally advanced, metastatic or unresectable HCC who have not previously received systemic anti-cancer treatment are eligible. The primary end point is the objective response rate at 6 months. Patients will be allocated to a treatment arm with a randomization 2:1. In both arms, patients will receive atezolizumab at fixed dose of 1200 mg IV infusion and bevacizumab at fixed dose of 15 mg/kg IV infusion, every 3 weeks, according to the standard of care. In the experimental arm, these treatments will be combined with the UCPVax vaccine at 0.5 mg subcutaneously. DISCUSSION: Combining anti-PD-1/PD-L1 therapy with an anti-telomerase vaccine gains serious consideration in HCC, in order to extend the clinical efficacy of anti-PD-1/PD-L1. Indeed, anti-cancer vaccines can induce tumor-specific T cell expansion and activation and therefore restore the cancer-immunity cycle in patients lacking pre-existing anti-tumor responses. Thus, there is a strong rational to combine immune checkpoint blockade therapy and anticancer vaccine (UCPVax) in order to activate antitumor T cell immunity and bypass the immunosuppression in the tumor microenvironment in HCC. This pivotal proof of concept study will evaluate the efficacy and safety of the combination of a CD4 Th1-inducer cancer vaccine derived from telomerase (UCPVax) and atezolizumab plus bevacizumab in unresectable HCC, as well as confirming their synergic mechanism, and settling the basis for a new combination for future clinical trials.

METHODS: A randomized controlled trial (RCT) was conducted with 144 patients, who were randomly assigned to receive either DEB-TACE with doxorubicin-loaded CalliSpheres((R)) microspheres or cTACE with doxorubicin-lipiodol emulsion. Patients were followed up for 12 months, with assessments at 3 and 12 months posttreatment. The primary endpoint was the clinical response rate (CR), and the secondary endpoints were the overall survival (OS), the progression-free survival (PFS), and the safety profile of the two treatments. RESULTS: The results showed that DEB-TACE was superior to cTACE in terms of CR (50.0% vs 30.6% at 3 months, p = 0.03; 43.1% vs 25.0% at 12 months, p = 0.04), OS (18.2 months vs 14.6 months, p < 0.05), and PFS (7.4 months vs 4.8 months, p < 0.05), and that the safety profile of the two treatments was similar (p > 0.05 for all comparisons). However, the efficacy of DEB-TACE and cTACE varied according to the tumor morphology. DEB-TACE showed better CR rates in patients with nodular tumors, while no significant difference in CR between the two groups in patients with infiltrative tumors. CONCLUSION: DEB-TACE showed superior efficacy to cTACE in terms of CR, OS, and PFS, particularly in patients with nodular tumors, while maintaining a similar safety profile. These findings suggest that tumor morphology could inform treatment decisions for TACE in HCC patients.",0.5125826470789169

However, to date, no systematic evaluations of these technologies have been conducted. This study sought to comparatively assess the safety and effectiveness of IRE and TACE for the treatment of very early and early-stage, inoperable HCC via systematic literature reviews (SLRs) and meta-analyses. METHODOLOGY: Searches were conducted targeting English-language publications and congress proceedings of clinical trials and observational studies from January 1, 2012 to December 21, 2023 that reported effectiveness and safety outcomes (tumor response, progression-free survival (PFS), adverse events (AE)) for IRE and TACE. Two reviewers independently assessed eligibility and abstracted data. For each procedure, meta-analyses were conducted to assess tumor response by follow-up time point, as data permitted, and other outcomes were descriptively analyzed; Quality and risk of bias assessments were performed. RESULTS: 12 IRE publications (195 patients) and 33 TACE publications (6,899 patients) met eligibility criteria. During 0 to < 3 month follow-up, complete response was achieved in 84% of IRE patients vs. 68% for TACE (all results at 1-month); a proportion that increased at 3 to < 6 months (91% IRE vs. 41% TACE). Median PFS was 10.4 months for IRE and 19-30 months for TACE. Serious AEs (SAEs) were experienced by 4% vs. 5% of IRE and TACE patients, respectively. CONCLUSION: Both IRE and TACE are safe and effective non-thermal treatments for unresectable, very early and early-stage HCC. The high rate of short-term complete response observed for IRE, coupled with a low SAE rate, may support the broader adoption of this procedure in this patient population.",0.5118664440969583

The precision, safety, and effectiveness of these therapies have increased with advances in guiding technologies and device improvements. Consequently, local ablation has become the first-line treatment for early-stage HCC. The lack of organized evidence and expert opinions regarding patient selection, pre-procedure preparation, procedural methods, swift post-treatment evaluation, and follow-up has resulted in clinicians following varied practices.

Anlotinib plus penpulimab has demonstrated encouraging activity and safety in a phase 2 study. In this phase 3 trial, we aimed to assess whether the combination of anlotinib plus penpulimab improved survival versus sorafenib in patients with unresectable HCC. METHODS: APOLLO was a multicentre, open-label, parallel-controlled, randomised, phase 3 trial conducted at 79 centres in China. Patients aged 18-75 years with unresectable HCC, no previous systemic therapy, and an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0 or 1 were randomly assigned (2:1) to anlotinib (10 mg orally once daily on days 1-14) plus penpulimab (200 mg intravenously on day 1), or sorafenib (400 mg orally twice daily) every 3 weeks. Randomisation was done centrally using block randomisation with a fixed block size of 3 and stratified by the presence of macrovascular invasion or extrahepatic metastasis, alpha-fetoprotein concentration, and ECOG performance status. Sex (male or female) and ethnicity (Chinese or other) were self-reported. The co-primary endpoints were progression-free survival assessed by masked independent review committee and overall survival in the intention-to-treat population. Safety was assessed in all participants who received at least one dose of the study drug and had at least one recorded safety assessment. Final progression-free survival and second interim overall survival analyses are presented. This trial is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04344158, and follow-up is ongoing. FINDINGS: From Aug 11, 2020, to June 20, 2023, 940 patients were screened for inclusion in the trial, 291 were excluded, and 649 were randomly assigned to an intervention (433 were assigned to the anlotinib plus penpulimab group and 216 were assigned to the sorafenib group. 551 (85%) of the 649 patients were male and 98 (15%) were female. All patients were Chinese with a median age of 57 years (IQR 50-65). For the final analysis of progression-free survival (June 5, 2023), 636 patients (424 patients in the anlotinib plus penpulimab group vs 212 patients in the sorafenib group) comprised the intention-to-treat population. For the second interim analysis of overall survival (Jan 29, 2024), 649 patients (433 vs 216) comprised the intention-to-treat population. Median follow-up was 6.2 months (IQR 5.5-7.5) for the anlotinib plus penpulimab group and 4.2 months (2.9-7.1) for the sorafenib group for final progression-free survival analysis, and 15.3 months (14.3-17.3) for the anlotinib plus penpulimab group and 14.5 months (11.5-17.0) for the sorafenib group for the second interim overall survival analysis. Median progression-free survival was significantly extended with anlotinib plus penpulimab versus sorafenib (6.9 months [95% CI 5.8-8.0] vs 2.8 months [2.7-4.1]; hazard ratio [HR] 0.52 [95% CI 0.41-0.66]; p<0.0001). Median overall survival was significantly prolonged with anlotinib plus penpulimab compared with sorafenib (16.5 months [95% CI 14.7-19.0] vs 13.2 months [9.7-16.9]; HR 0.69 [95% CI 0.55-0.87]; p=0.0014). The most common grade 3 or worse treatment-related adverse events were hypertension (75 [17%] patients in the anlotinib plus penpulimab group vs 22 [10%] in the sorafenib group) and decrease in platelet count (39 [9%] vs 13 [6%]). Treatment-related serious adverse events occurred in 90 (21%) and 19 (9%) patients in the respective groups; treatment-related deaths occurred in one (<1%) patient in the anlotinib plus penpulimab group (upper gastrointestinal haemorrhage) and two (1%) patients in the sorafenib group (hepatic failure and death of unknown cause). INTERPRETATION: Anlotinib plus penpulimab significantly improved progression-free survival and overall survival versus sorafenib in unresectable HCC and might be a new first-line option. These findings require verification in other regions of the world. FUNDING: Chia Tai Tianqing Pharmaceutical Group.",0.5083494831249218

Many patients with early-stage HCC do not receive curative-intent therapies. Stereotactic ablative body radiotherapy (SABR) has emerged as an effective, non-invasive HCC treatment option, however, randomized evidence for SABR in the first line setting is lacking. METHODS: Trans-Tasman Radiation Oncology Group (TROG) 21.07 SOCRATES-HCC is a phase II, prospective, randomised trial comparing SABR to other current standard of care therapies for patients with a solitary HCC </= 8 cm, ineligible for surgical resection or transplantation. The study is divided into 2 cohorts. Cohort 1 will compromise 118 patients with tumors </= 3 cm eligible for thermal ablation randomly assigned (1:1 ratio) to thermal ablation or SABR. Cohort 2 will comprise 100 patients with tumors > 3 cm up to 8 cm in size, or tumors </= 3 cm ineligible for thermal ablation, randomly assigned (1:1 ratio) to SABR or best other standard of care therapy including transarterial therapies. The primary objective is to determine whether SABR results in superior freedom from local progression (FFLP) at 2 years compared to thermal ablation in cohort 1 and compared to best standard of care therapy in cohort 2. Secondary endpoints include progression free survival, overall survival, adverse events, patient reported outcomes and health economic analyses. DISCUSSION: The SOCRATES-HCC study will provide the first randomized, multicentre evaluation of the efficacy, safety and cost effectiveness of SABR versus other standard of care therapies in the first line treatment of unresectable, early-stage HCC. It is a broad, multicentre collaboration between hepatology, interventional radiology and radiation oncology groups around Australia, coordinated by TROG Cancer Research.

METHODS: The American Society for Radiation Oncology convened a task force to address 5 key questions focused on the indications, techniques, and outcomes of EBRT in HCC and IHC. This guideline is intended to cover the definitive, consolidative, salvage, preoperative (including bridge to transplant), and adjuvant settings as well as palliative EBRT for symptomatic primary lesions. Recommendations were based on a systematic literature review and created using a predefined consensus-building methodology and system for grading evidence quality and recommendation strength. RESULTS: Strong recommendations are made for using EBRT as a potential first-line treatment in patients with liver-confined HCC who are not candidates for curative therapy, as consolidative therapy after incomplete response to liver-directed therapies, and as a salvage option for local recurrences. The guideline conditionally recommends EBRT for patients with liver-confined multifocal or unresectable HCC or those with macrovascular invasion, sequenced with systemic or catheter-based therapies. Palliative EBRT is conditionally recommended for symptomatic primary HCC and/or macrovascular tumor thrombi. EBRT is conditionally recommended as a bridge to transplant or before surgery in carefully selected patients. For patients with unresectable IHC, consolidative EBRT with or without chemotherapy should be considered, typically after systemic therapy. Adjuvant EBRT is conditionally recommended for resected IHC with high-risk features. Selection of dose-fractionation regimen and technique should be based on disease extent, disease location, underlying liver function, and available technologies. CONCLUSIONS: The task force has proposed recommendations to inform best clinical practices on the use of EBRT for HCC and IHC with strong emphasis on multidisciplinary care. Future studies should focus on further defining the role of EBRT in the context of liver-directed and systemic therapies and refining optimal regimens and techniques.",0.5051145224295972

This study aimed to evaluate the addition of pembrolizumab to lenvatinib versus lenvatinib plus placebo in the first-line setting for unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma. METHODS: In this global, randomised, double-blind, phase 3 study (LEAP-002), patients aged 18 years or older with unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma, Child Pugh class A liver disease, an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0 or 1, and no previous systemic treatment were enrolled at 172 global sites. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) with a central interactive voice-response system (block size of 4) to receive lenvatinib (bodyweight <60 kg, 8 mg/day; bodyweight >/=60 kg, 12 mg/day) plus pembrolizumab (200 mg every 3 weeks) or lenvatinib plus placebo. Randomisation was stratified by geographical region, macrovascular portal vein invasion or extrahepatic spread or both, alpha-fetoprotein concentration, and Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status. Dual primary endpoints were overall survival (superiority threshold at final overall survival analysis, one-sided p=0.019; final analysis to occur after 532 events) and progression-free survival (superiority threshold one-sided p=0.002; final analysis to occur after 571 events) in the intention-to-treat population. Results from the final analysis are reported. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03713593, and is active but not recruiting. FINDINGS: Between Jan 17, 2019, and April 28, 2020, of 1309 patients assessed, 794 were randomly assigned to lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab (n=395) or lenvatinib plus placebo (n=399). Median age was 66.0 years (IQR 57.0-72.0), 644 (81%) of 794 were male, 150 (19%) were female, 345 (43%) were Asian, 345 (43%) were White, 22 (3%) were multiple races, 21 (3%) were American Indian or Alaska Native, 21 (3%) were Native Hawaiian or other Pacific Islander, 13 (2%) were Black or African American, and 46 (6%) did not have available race data. Median follow up as of data cutoff for the final analysis (June 21, 2022) was 32.1 months (IQR 29.4-35.3). Median overall survival was 21.2 months (95% CI 19.0-23.6; 252 [64%] of 395 died) with lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab versus 19.0 months (17.2-21.7; 282 [71%] of 399 died) with lenvatinib plus placebo (hazard ratio [HR] 0.84; 95% CI 0.71-1.00; stratified log-rank p=0.023). As of data cutoff for the progression-free survival final analysis (April 5, 2021), median progression-free survival was 8.2 months (95% CI 6.4-8.4; 270 events occurred [42 deaths; 228 progressions]) with lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab versus 8.0 months (6.3-8.2; 301 events occurred [36 deaths; 265 progressions]) with lenvatinib plus placebo (HR 0.87; 95% CI 0.73-1.02; stratified log-rank p=0.047). The most common treatment-related grade 3-4 adverse events were hypertension (69 [17%] of 395 patients in the lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab group vs 68 [17%] of 395 patients) in the lenvatinib plus placebo group), increased aspartate aminotransferase (27 [7%] vs 17 [4%]), and diarrhoea (25 [6%] vs 15 [4%]). Treatment-related deaths occurred in four (1%) patients in the lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab group (due to gastrointestinal haemorrhage and hepatorenal syndrome [n=1 each] and hepatic encephalopathy [n=2]) and in three (1%) patients in the lenvatinib plus placebo group (due to gastrointestinal haemorrhage, hepatorenal syndrome, and cerebrovascular accident [n=1 each]). INTERPRETATION: In earlier studies, the addition of pembrolizumab to lenvatinib as first-line therapy for advanced hepatocellular carcinoma has shown promising clinical activity; however, lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab did not meet prespecified significance for improved overall survival and progression-free survival versus lenvatinib plus placebo.

We aimed to assess whether adding durvalumab, with or without bevacizumab, might improve progression-free survival. METHODS: In this multiregional, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 3 study (EMERALD-1), adults aged 18 years or older with unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma amenable to embolisation, an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0 or 1 at enrolment, and at least one measurable intrahepatic lesion per modified Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumours (RECIST) were enrolled at 157 medical sites including research centres and general and specialist hospitals in 18 countries. Eligible patients were randomly assigned (1:1:1), stratified by TACE method, region, and portal vein invasion, using an interactive voice response or web response system, to TACE plus either durvalumab plus bevacizumab (1500 mg intravenous durvalumab once every 4 weeks, then 1120 mg durvalumab plus 15 mg/kg intravenous bevacizumab once every 3 weeks), durvalumab plus placebo (same regimen using placebo instead of bevacizumab), or placebo alone (same regimen using placebo instead of durvalumab and instead of bevacizumab). Participants, investigators, and those assessing outcomes were masked to treatment assignment until data analysis. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival, by blinded independent central review (BICR), and per RECIST version 1.1, with durvalumab plus bevacizumab versus placebo alone in the intention-to-treat population (ITT; ie, all participants assigned to treatment). Key secondary endpoints were progression-free survival by BICR per RECIST version 1.1 with durvalumab plus placebo versus placebo alone, overall survival, and time to deterioration in select patient-reported outcomes. Participants continue to be followed up for overall survival, and overall survival and patient-reported outcomes will be reported in a later publication. Safety was assessed in the safety analysis set, which included all participants assigned to treatment who received any study treatment (ie, any durvalumab, bevacizumab, or placebo) by treatment received. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03778957, and is closed to accrual. FINDINGS: Between Nov 30, 2018, and July 19, 2021, 887 patients were screened, of whom 616 were randomly assigned to durvalumab plus bevacizumab (n=204), durvalumab plus placebo (n=207), or placebo alone (n=205; ITT population). Median age was 65.0 years (IQR 59.0-72.0), 135 (22%) of 616 participants were female, 481 (78%) were male, 375 (61%) were Asian, 176 (29%) were White, 22 (4%) were American Indian or Alaska Native, nine (1%) were Black or African American, one (<1%) was native Hawaiian or other Pacific Islander, and 33 (5%) were other races. As of data cutoff (Sept 11, 2023) median follow-up for progression-free survival was 27.9 months (95% CI 27.4-30.4), median progression-free survival was 15.0 months (95% CI 11.1-18.9) with durvalumab plus bevacizumab, 10.0 months (9.0-12.7) with durvalumab, and 8.2 months (6.9-11.1) with placebo. Progression-free survival hazard ratio was 0.77 (95% CI 0.61-0.98; two-sided p=0.032) for durvalumab plus bevacizumab versus placebo, and 0.94 (0.75-1.19; two-sided p=0.64) for durvalumab plus placebo versus placebo. The most common maximum grade 3-4 adverse events were hypertension in participants who received durvalumab and bevacizumab (nine [6%] of 154 participants), anaemia in participants who received durvalumab and placebo (ten [4%] of 232 participants), and post-embolisation syndrome in participants who received placebo alone (eight [4%] of 200 participants). Study treatment-related adverse events that led to death occurred in none of 154 participants who received durvalumab and bevacizumab, three (1%) of 232 who received durvalumab and placebo (n=1 for arterial haemorrhage, liver injury, and multiple organ dysfunction syndrome), and three (2%) of 200 who received placebo alone (n=1 for oesophageal varices haemorrhage, upper gastrointestinal haemorrhage, and dermatomyositis). INTERPRETATION: Durvalumab plus bevacizumab plus TACE has the potential to set a new standard of care. With additional follow-up of the EMERALD-1 study, future analyses, including the final overall survival data and patient-reported outcomes, will help to further characterise the potential clinical benefits of durvalumab plus bevacizumab plus TACE in hepatocellular carcinoma amenable to embolisation.

This study aimed to evaluate the surrogacy of progression-free survival (PFS) and one-year (1-yr) milestone survival for OS in HCC trials. METHODS: We systematically searched databases for randomized clinical trials that evaluated systemic treatments for advanced HCC. Individual patient data were reconstructed to calculate the 1-yr survival rate. We adopted a two-stage meta-analytic validation model to evaluate the correlation between SEs and OS, and the correlation between treatment effects on SEs and OS. The hazard ratio (HR) was calculated to assess the treatment effects on PFS and OS, and the 1-yr survival ratio was calculated to evaluate the treatment effects on the 1-yr milestone survival. RESULTS: Thirty-two HCC trials involving 13,808 patients were included. A weak correlation was detected between the median PFS and median OS (R2 = 0.32), whereas the correlation improved between PFS HR and OS HR (R2 = 0.58). We identified strong correlations between the 1-yr survival rate and median OS and between the 1-yr survival ratio and OS HR (R2 = 0.74 and 0.65, respectively). In subgroup analyses, PFS HR strongly correlated with OS HR in trials relevant to immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs). Although the correlation remained weak between PFS and OS even in trials with PFS HR </= 0.6, the 1-yr survival rate and 1-yr survival ratio were strong surrogates for median OS and OS HR, respectively (R2 = 0.77 and 0.75). CONCLUSIONS: One-year milestone survival outperformed PFS as a SE for OS in HCC, indicating the application of 1-yr survival as a secondary endpoint. In particular, PFS HR was a potential SE for OS HR in the ICI trials.",0.5041545733686729

The combination of advanced targeted therapies such as immunotherapy, with conventional treatments has gained traction for application on HCC. Immunotoxins (ITs) represent a category of biomolecules that combine the targeted affinity of antibodies with the cytotoxic properties of toxins. AREAS COVERED: This study highlights Glypican3 (GPC3) as a potential candidate for targeted therapeutic interventions using ITs. It presents a comprehensive overview of the advantages and challenges associated with these modalities, and their promising outcomes in HCC treatment. A systematic literature review was conducted using PubMed, Web of Science and Scopus from 2015 to 2024. EXPERT OPINION: Despite potential applicability, many concerns should be addressed before the employment of GPC3-based ITs. These include improving efficient penetration of ITs into the solid tumors, considering neutralizing antibodies against the drugs, and enhancing serum half-life of ITs. Furthermore, the ITs potential in eliminating cancer stem cells (CSCs) and residual tumor cells is discussed. The ability to target CSCs can significantly reduce the likelihood of recurrence and improve overall survival rate. This could make ITs a pivotal component in the future of HCC treatment.",0.5038791068397598

METHODS: Relevant literature on TACE combined with apatinib plus PD-1 inhibitors for advanced HCC was searched in PubMed, Cochrane Library, Embase, and Web of Science databases. Trial sequential analysis (TSA) was conducted to minimize randomization errors and assess whether the meta-analysis provided conclusive evidence. RESULTS: Six studies involving 1,452 patients were included. Compared with the TACE combined with apatinib treatment group (T-A), TACE combined with apatinib plus PD-1 inhibitors (T-A-P) significantly prolonged overall survival (OS) (Hazard Ratio [HR] 2.22, 95% Confidence Interval [CI] 1.93-2.56; p < 0.001) and progression-free survival (PFS) (HR 2.36, 95% CI 2.01-2.77; p < 0.001), while also improving the objective response rate (ORR) (risk ratios [RR] 1.60, 95% CI 1.20-2.14; p < 0.001) and disease control rate (DCR) (RR 1.06, 95% CI 1.00-1.12; p < 0.001). TSA results indicated that additional studies were required to confirm the significance of DCR. Prognostic analysis identified treatment regimen and extrahepatic metastasis as common independent risk factors for OS and PFS. The incidence of adverse events in the T-A-P treatment group was comparable to that in the T-A treatment group. CONCLUSION: Adding PD-1 inhibitors to TACE combined with apatinib significantly prolonged OS and PFS, particularly in patients without extrahepatic metastases. It also improved ORR and DCR in patients with HCC.",0.502215808462742

Despite treatment advancements, survival rates for unresectable HCC remain low. Lenvatinib and the combination of atezolizumab and bevacizumab (ATE/BEV) show promise, but further studies are needed to compare their clinical outcomes. This study aims to assess the efficacy and safety of LEN and ATE/BEV in unresectable HCC patients. METHODS: This research was conducted using the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) strategy. Literature searches were conducted through PubMed, ScienceDirect, Google Scholar, Cochrane Library, SpringerLink, and Ebsco to gather studies on comparing LEN versus ATE/BEV for managing unresectable HCC. The quality assessment was assessed using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS). Overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS), objective response rate (ORR), disease control rate (DCR) and treatment-related adverse events (AEs) were evaluated using Review Manager 5.4 and RStudio 2024.04.1. RESULTS: Twelve retrospective studies were included, comprising 6,620 samples. There was no difference in the OS (HR=0.72; 95%CI: 0.44-1.18, p=0.20), PFS (HR=0.90; 95%CI: 0.75-1.07; p=0.23), ORR (OR=1.16; 95%CI:0.86-1.56; p=0.34) and DCR (OR=1.14; 95%CI:0.97-1.34; p=0.12) between groups. Moreover, in viral and non-viral patients group, LEN showed similar OS and PFS compared with ATE/BEV. In terms of safety, LEN exhibited higher incidences of decreased appetite (OR=2.95; 95%CI:1.12-7.79; p=0.03), diarrhea (OR=2.61; 95%CI:2.06-3.32; p<0.00001), fatigue (OR=1.48; 95%CI:1.27-1.73; P<0.00001), hand-foot syndrome (OR=7.73; 95%CI:4.84-12.33; P<0.00001), and showed lower incidences of increased aspartate aminotransferase (OR=0.44; 95%CI:0.28-0.69; p=0.0004) compared to ATE/BEV. Moreover, LEN showed similar AEs in grade >/= 3 AEs (OR=1.15; 95%CI:0.29-4.55; p=0.84), hypertension (OR=1.39; 95%CI:0.84-2.28; p=0.20), proteinuria (OR=1.10; 95%CI:0.75-1.60; p=0.63) compared to ATE/BEV. CONCLUSION: LEN was found to be non-inferior to ATE/BEV in terms of OS, PFS, ORR, DCR. However, LEN may be associated with a higher incidence of AEs.",0.5010269511514351

However, the clinical impact of temporary interruptions of Atez and Bev on treatment outcomes remains unclear. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the association between temporary interruptions of Atez or Bev and survival outcomes among patients with unresectable HCC. DESIGN: Exploratory post hoc analysis of patient-level data from the phase 3 IMbrave150 (NCT03434379) trial. SETTING: Global, multicenter, randomized phase 3 trial designed to evaluate the therapeutic benefit of Atez plus Bev compared with sorafenib in patients with unresectable HCC. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 251 patients with unresectable HCC who received Atez and Bev in the IMbrave150 trial. EXPOSURES: Temporary interruptions of Atez or Bev during treatment. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS). RESULTS: Among 251 patients treated with Atez/Bev, 79 (31.5%) experienced Atez interruptions and 86 (34.3%) had Bev interruptions. Interruptions were not significantly associated with OS (HR = 1.57, 95% CI: 0.90-2.73 for Atez, HR = 0.50, 95% CI: 0.16-1.53 for Bev). However, both were significantly associated with improved PFS (HR = 0.56, 95% CI: 0.34-0.92 for Atez and HR = 0.61, 95% CI: 0.39-0.94 for Bev). Subgroup analyses showed that positive association of PFS and interruptions was primarily observed in patients with events or treatment duration <12 months. Early (within 6 months) and late interruptions (after 6 months) showed trends toward longer PFS but were not statistically significant (HR = 0.56, 95% CI: 0.27-1.15 and HR = 0.57, 95% CI: 0.29-1.09 for Atez, HR = 0.61, 95% CI: 0.37-1.02, and HR = 0.60, 95% CI: 0.29-1.27 for Bev). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this exploratory analysis, temporary interruptions of Atez or Bev were not associated with worse survival outcomes in patients with unresectable HCC.

For more than a decade, sorafenib has been the classic first-line treatment option for patients with advanced HCC. However, the results of clinical studies comparing the efficacy and safety of these 2 drugs are still controversial. Therefore, the aim of this meta-analysis is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of apatinib versus sorafenib as first-line treatment for advanced HCC. METHODS: Up to August 14, 2023, the databases of PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, ClinicalTrials.gov, China National Knowledge Infrastructure, and Wanfang were searched, and clinical studies of experimental group (apatinib or apatinib plus transarterial chemoembolization [TACE]) versus control group (sorafenib or sorafenib plus TACE) in the first-line treatment of advanced HCC were included. Two researchers evaluated the quality of the included studies and extracted the data. Revman 5.4 software was used for meta-analysis. RESULTS: A total of 12 studies involving 1150 patients were included. Five studies are apatinib alone versus sorafenib alone, and the other 7 studies are apatinib plus TACE versus sorafenib plus TACE. The results of the meta-analysis showed that compared with sorafenib alone, apatinib could improve (OR = 3.06, 95%CI: 1.76-5.31), had no advantage in improving DCR (OR = 1.52, 95%CI: 0.86-2.68) and prolonging PFS (HR = 1.35, 95%CI: 0.94-1.96), and was significantly worse in prolonging OS (HR = 1.43, 95%CI: 1.08-1.88). Similarly, apatinib plus TACE was inferior to sorafenib plus TACE in prolonging OS (HR = 1.15, 95%CI: 1.03-1.28), although it improved ORR (OR = 1.49, 95%CI: 1.03-2.16). In terms of adverse drug events, the overall incidence of adverse events, and the incidence of drug reduction and discontinuation in the experimental group were significantly higher than those in the control group (P < .05). The incidence of hypertension, proteinuria, and oral mucositis in the experimental group was significantly higher than that in the control group (P < .05). CONCLUSION: In the setting of first-line treatment of advanced HCC, apatinib has improved short-term efficacy (ORR) compared with sorafenib, but the safety and long-term efficacy of apatinib are inferior to sorafenib.",0.5007441971951678

Combining selective internal radiation therapy (SIRT) with immunotherapy has been suggested to potentially improve outcomes in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and metastatic colorectal carcinoma (mCRC). In this systematic review, the authors discuss the current developments and available clinical data regarding the combination of immunotherapy and SIRT in treating hepatic malignancies. Methods: PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane library were systematically searched for eligible studies (adhering to Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines). Original patient studies written in English language with patients with HCC or mCRC who were treated with SIRT and immunotherapy were included. Endpoints evaluated included overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS), and objective response rate (ORR). Results: 1038 publications were screened, from which 1034 publications were excluded. Four studies with a total of 87 patients were included in this systematic review, of which two consisted of mCRC and the other two HCC. All four studies showed no increased toxicities of the combination therapy over known data on monotherapy. One mCRC study reported a median OS of 8 months, while the other mCRC study ended due to futility. Both reported an ORR of 0%. The two HCC studies reported a median OS of 16.5 and 16.2 months. Median PFS was 5.6 and 5.7 months. ORR ranged from 31% to 80%. Conclusion: The combination of SIRT and immunotherapy has been studied in four early-phase studies showing a favorable safety profile.

Gene therapy, which uses genes to treat or prevent diseases, holds potential for treatment, especially for tumours. Trials on the effects of gene therapy in people with hepatocellular carcinoma have been published or are ongoing. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the benefits and harms of gene therapy in people with hepatocellular carcinoma, irrespective of sex, administered dose, and type of formulation. SEARCH METHODS: We identified randomised clinical trials through electronic searches in The Cochrane Hepato-Biliary Group Controlled Trials Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, LILACS, Science Citation Index Expanded, and Conference Proceedings Citation Index-Science. We searched five online clinical trial registries to identify unpublished or ongoing trials. We checked reference lists of the retrieved studies for further trials. The date of last search was 20 January 2023. SELECTION CRITERIA: We aimed to include randomised clinical trials assessing any type of gene therapy in people diagnosed with hepatocellular carcinoma, irrespective of year, language of publication, format, or outcomes reported. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: We followed Cochrane methodology and used Review Manager to prepare the review. The primary outcomes were all-cause mortality/overall survival (whatever data were provided), serious adverse events during treatment, and health-related quality of life. The secondary outcomes were proportion of people with disease progression, adverse events considered non-serious, and proportion of people without improvement in liver function tests. We assessed risk of bias of the included trials using RoB 2 and the certainty of evidence using GRADE. We presented the results of time-to-event outcomes as hazard ratios (HR), dichotomous outcomes as risk ratios (RR), and continuous outcomes as mean difference (MD) with their 95% confidence intervals (CI). Our primary analyses were based on intention-to-treat and outcome data at the longest follow-up. MAIN RESULTS: We included six randomised clinical trials with 364 participants. The participants had unresectable (i.e. advanced inoperable) hepatocellular carcinoma. We found no trials assessing the effects of gene therapy in people with operable hepatocellular carcinoma. Four trials were conducted in China, one in several countries (from North America, Asia, and Europe), and one in Egypt. The number of participants in the six trials ranged from 10 to 129 (median 47), median age was 55.2 years, and the mean proportion of males was 72.7%. The follow-up duration ranged from six months to five years. As the trials compared different types of gene therapy and had different controls, we could not perform meta-analyses. Five of the six trials administered co-interventions equally to the experimental and control groups. All trials assessed one or more outcomes of interest in this review. The certainty of evidence was very low in five of the six comparisons and low in the double-dose gene therapy comparison. Below, we reported the results of the primary outcomes only. Pexastimogene devacirepvec (Pexa-Vec) plus best supportive care versus best supportive care alone There is uncertainty about whether there may be little to no difference between the effect of Pexa-Vec plus best supportive care compared with best supportive care alone on overall survival (HR 1.19, 95% CI 0.78 to 1.82; 1 trial (censored observation at 20-month follow-up), 129 participants; very low-certainty evidence) and on serious adverse events (RR 1.42, 95% CI 0.60 to 3.33; 1 trial at 20 months after treatment, 129 participants; very low-certainty evidence). The trial reported quality of life narratively as ""assessment of quality of life and time to symptomatic progression was confounded by the high patient dropout rate."" Adenovirus-thymidine kinase with ganciclovir (ADV-TK/GCV) plus liver transplantation versus liver transplantation alone There is uncertainty about whether ADV-TK/GCV plus liver transplantation may benefit all-cause mortality at the two-year follow-up (RR 0.39, 95% CI 0.20 to 0.76; 1 trial, 45 participants; very low-certainty evidence). The trial did not report serious adverse events other than mortality or quality of life. Double-dose ADV-TK/GCV plus liver transplantation versus liver transplantation alone There is uncertainty about whether double-dose ADV-TK/GCV plus liver transplantation versus liver transplantation may benefit all-cause mortality at five-year follow-up (RR 0.40, 95% CI 0.22 to 0.73; 1 trial, 86 participants; low-certainty evidence). The trial did not report serious adverse events other than mortality or quality of life. Recombinant human adenovirus-p53 with hydroxycamptothecin (rAd-p53/HCT) versus hydroxycamptothecin alone There is uncertainty about whether there may be little to no difference between the effect of rAd-p53/HCT versus hydroxycamptothecin alone on the overall survival at 12-month follow-up (RR 3.06, 95% CI 0.16 to 60.47; 1 trial, 48 participants; very low-certainty evidence). The trial did not report serious adverse events or quality of life. rAd-p53/5-Fu (5-fluorouracil) plus transarterial chemoembolisation versus transarterial chemoembolisation alone The trial included 46 participants. We had insufficient data to assess overall survival. The trial did not report serious adverse events or quality of life. E1B-deleted (dl1520) adenovirus versus percutaneous ethanol injection The trial included 10 participants. It did not report data on overall survival, serious adverse events, or health-related quality of life. One trial did not provide any information on sponsorship; one trial received a national research grant, one trial by the Pedersen foundation, and three were industry-funded trials. We found five ongoing randomised clinical trials. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: The evidence is very uncertain about the effects of gene therapy on the studied outcomes because of high risk of bias and imprecision of outcome results. The trials were underpowered and lacked trial data on clinically important outcomes. There was only one trial per comparison, and we could not perform meta-analyses. Therefore, we do not know if gene therapy may reduce, increase, or have little to no effect on all-cause mortality or overall survival, or serious adverse events in adults with unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma. The impact of gene therapy on adverse events needs to be investigated further. Evidence on the effect of gene therapy on health-related quality of life is lacking.",0.4996525842717654

This review aimed to discuss the most recent updates in the epidemiology, pathophysiology, risk factors, diagnosis as well as presentation, management, and prognostic factors of rHCC. METHODS: A comprehensive systematic review was conducted using Medline/PubMed and Web of Science databases with the end of search date being December 1, 2023 regarding rHCC diagnosis, imaging, and management. RESULTS: Achieving adequate hemostasis and stabilization of the patient remains the primary objective in the management of patients with rHCC. In earlier studies, the mortality rate in the acute phase of rHCC was reported to be 25 % to 75 %. However, more recent studies have demonstrated that transcatheter arterial embolization (TAE)/transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE) followed by elective hepatectomy in select patients may offer improved survival benefits and decrease perioperative complications compared with TAE/TACE alone or emergent/1-stage hepatectomy. CONCLUSION: Although the prognosis for rHCC remains the worst among causes of death related to HCC, more recent studies have demonstrated that improved short- and long-term patient outcomes may be achieved through active surveillance efforts for HCC combined with advanced multimodal diagnostic tools and multidisciplinary management strategies.",0.4989369968549998

However, the safety profiles of HAIC and its various combination therapies remain to be systematically evaluated. METHODS: We systematically searched PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, and Web of Science databases from inception to November 2024. Studies reporting adverse events (AEs) of HAIC monotherapy or combination therapies in HCC were included. The severity and frequency of AEs were analyzed according to different treatment protocols. RESULTS: A total of 58 studies (11 prospective, 47 retrospective) were included. HAIC monotherapy demonstrated relatively mild toxicity, primarily affecting hepatobiliary (transaminase elevation 53.2%, hypoalbuminemia 57.2%) and hematological systems (anemia 43.0%, thrombocytopenia 35.2%). HAIC with targeted therapy showed increased adverse events, including characteristic reactions like hand-foot syndrome (48.0%) and hypertension (49.9%). HAIC combined with targeted, and immunotherapy exhibited the highest adverse reaction rates (neutropenia 82.9%, transaminase elevation 97.1%), while HAIC with anti-angiogenic and immunotherapy showed a relatively favorable safety profile. Prospective studies consistently reported higher incidence rates than retrospective studies, suggesting potential underreporting in clinical practice.

Patients were stratified according to the SMAART score: low risk, 0-2; medium risk, 3-4; and high risk, 5-8. Prediction error curves based on the integrated Brier score and the Harrell C-index validated the SMAART scores and compared them with the Assessment for Retreatment with Transarterial chemoembolization (ART) score. RESULTS: The low-risk group had the longest median overall survival of 39.0 months, followed by the medium-risk and high-risk groups of 21.2 months and 10.5 months, respectively, with significant differences (P < 0.001). The validation cohort had similar results. The high-risk group had 63.1% TACE refractory cases. The Harrell C-indexes were 0.562 and 0.665 and the integrated Brier scores were 0.176 and 0.154 for ART and SMAART scores, respectively. DISCUSSION: The SMAART score can aid clinicians in selecting appropriate candidates for subsequent cTACE. A SMAART score of >/=5 after the first cTACE session identified patients with poor prognosis who may not benefit from additional cTACE sessions.",0.49208856378272225

This unique systematic literature review and meta-analysis was undertaken to assess the effectiveness and safety of metronomic capecitabine as a treatment regimen for hepatocellular carcinoma. METHOD: A systematic search of major databases was performed. Eight studies that dealt with the use of metronomic capecitabine for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) were selected, seven were non-randomized control trials (n-RCTs), and one was a randomized control trial (RCT). Meta-analysis of these studies was performed using Review Manager v5.3 and STATA 15.1 software. The pooled prevalence of overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS), overall response rate (ORR), grade 1-2 adverse events (grade 1-2 AEs), grade 3-4 adverse events (grade 3-4 AEs) was determined, including publication bias and sensitivity analysis. RESULT: Eight studies met the inclusion criteria, combining the pooled data of 476 patients from safety and efficacy studies. The pooled prevalence of disease control rate (DCR) and overall response rate (ORR) achieved with metronomic capecitabine was 36% (95% CI 32-41) and 7% (95% CI 5-9) respectively. The median progression-free survival (PFS) and median overall survival (OS) were 3.57 months (95% CI 3.29-3.85) and 11.75 months (95% CI 10.56-12.95) respectively. The incidence of grade 3-4 adverse events (grade 3-4 AEs) and grade 1-2 adverse events (grade 1-2 AEs) was 38% (95% CI 32-44) and 73% (95% CI 67-79) respectively. CONCLUSION: This meta-analysis highlights metronomic capecitabine as a potential treatment for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in the advanced stage. However, effective management of capecitabine's side effects is essential.",0.4914954465595426

This work was to determine whether TAE was as effective and safe as TACE for unresectable HCC. METHODS: We performed a systematic search of electronic databases and other sources for randomized controlled studies (RCTs) comparing TAE with TACE for unresectable HCC. Results were expressed as Hazard Ratio (HR) for survival and Odds Ratio (OR) for dichotomous outcomes using RevMan 5.4.1. RESULTS: We included 6 trials with 683 patients. The risk of bias of included RCTs was from unclear to high risk. There were no significant differences between TACE and TAE for progression-free survival (HR 0.83, 95% CI 0.45-1.55; p = 0.57), overall survival (HR 1.10, 95% CI 0.90-1.35; p = 0.36), and objective response rate (OR 1.17, 95% CI 0.80-1.71; p = 0.42) without obvious publication bias. Sensitivity analyses confirmed the robustness of the results. TAE group reported similar or less adverse effects than TACE group in all the studies. CONCLUSIONS: Our study demonstrated that TAE was as effective as TACE. Since TAE was simpler, cheaper and had less adverse effects than TACE, TAE should be a better choice in most cases where TACE was indicated for unresectable HCC.",0.4900638438910273

OBJECTIVE: To conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis of available data and establish a reference range for C(max) and AUC of doxorubicin DEB-TACE and TACE, as well as explore the potential influence of microspheres' size and type on these parameters. METHODS: PubMed, EMBASE, and Web of Science were searched from August 1992 through December 2021. Studies measuring exposure parameters among HCC patients treated with doxorubicin DEB-TACE without restriction on language were included. Two independent reviewers extracted and unified data sets for pooled estimate analysis. The quality of the evidence was assessed via the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation framework. The ClinPK Statement checklist and Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS) were used to determine the quality of studies. RESULTS: Out of 666 studies, 246 full-text were reviewed, and 8 studies entered the meta-analysis (120 patients). C(max) and AUC of doxorubicin were 7.52-fold (95% CI 7.65 to 7.42-fold; P < 0.0001) and 1.91-fold (95% CI 1.95 to 1.88-fold; P = 0.0001) lower with DEB-TACE compared to TACE. Significant reduction in pooled standardized mean difference (SMD) of C(max) and AUC was observed with DEB-TACE versus TACE in direct comparison analysis (- 2.93; 95% CI - 3.60 to - 2.26, P < 0.00001, and - 1.73 95% CI - 2.55 to - 0.91, P < 0.0001, respectively). Moreover, in DEB-TACE stratification analysis, small microspheres revealed higher C(max), AUC and tumor response rate as well as lower complication rate. LIMITATION: The heterogeneity could not be completely addressed through sensitivity and stratification analysis. CONCLUSION: This meta-analysis provides exposure parameters of doxorubicin and justifies the advantage of DEB-TACE over TACE in terms of safety for patients with unresectable HCC. This study showed a marked association between the size of microsphere and exposure parameters of doxorubicin supporting the preference for small microspheres in DEB-TACE. The moderate and low quality of evidence is assigned to the C(max) and AUC, respectively.",0.48795517097014307

Transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) is the standard locoregional therapy for unresectable HCC but is limited by high recurrence and hepatic toxicity. Low-molecular-weight fucoidan (LMF), a sulfated polysaccharide from brown seaweed, has anticancer and hepatoprotective properties. This study assessed whether LMF enhances tumour response and preserves liver function when combined with TACE. METHODS: In this randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, 82 patients with unresectable HCC were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive LMF (4.4 g twice daily) or placebo for 6 months in addition to TACE. Tumour response was assessed using modified RECIST criteria, and liver function was monitored via Child-Pugh classification. The primary endpoint was disease control rate (DCR), with objective response rate (ORR), liver function and adverse events as secondary endpoints. RESULTS: Baseline characteristics were well balanced. DCR was significantly higher in the LMF group (95.24% vs. 80.00%, p = 0.035), with a lower progressive disease rate (4.76% vs. 20.00%). ORR was higher in the LMF group (52.38% vs. 35.00%) but not statistically significant (p = 0.1129). LMF preserved liver function (p = 0.029), with more patients maintaining Child-Pugh Class A (80.95% vs. 62.50%). Adverse event rates were similar, and no severe adverse events occurred. CONCLUSIONS: LMF improved tumour control, preserved liver function and had a favourable safety profile. These findings suggest LMF may mitigate TACE-related hepatic toxicity and prolong treatment eligibility, warranting further validation in larger trials.",0.4877805930616387

Medline, EMBASE, and Cochrane Library database searches were conducted, revealing nine relevant cohort studies (seven PDL-1 and three PD-1). Our meta-analysis showed that PD-1/PDL-1 was a marker of poor survival, regardless of the assessment method (PD-1 overall survival (OS): hazard ratio (HR) 2.40; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.30-4.42; disease-free survival (DFS): HR 2.12; 95% CI, 1.45-3.10; PDL-1: OS: HR 3.61; 95% CI, 2.75-4.75; and DFS: HR 2.74; 95% CI, 2.09-3.59). Additionally, high level of PD-1/PDL-1 expression was associated with aging, multiple tumors, high alpha-fetoprotein levels, and advanced Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer stage. This high level significantly predicted a poor prognosis for HCC, suggesting that anti-PD-1 therapy is plausible for patients with HCC. Furthermore, HIF-1 induces PD-1 expression, and PD1(low)SOCS3(high) is associated with a better prognosis. Taken together, combination therapy may be the key to effective immunotherapy. Thus, exploring other markers, such as HIF-1 and SOCS3, along with PD-1/PDL-1 immunotherapy, may lead to improved outcomes.",0.485794572580867

RevMan5.3 software and Stata 13.0 software were used for statistical analyses. The primary endpoint of our study was long-term survival. RESULTS: A total of 11 studies with 2036 patients were finally identified. Pooled results revealed that patients receiving TACE had a significantly better overall survival (OS) versus those without TACE (P < 0.05). Subgroup analyses were performed according to different types of TACE. Prophylactic post-surgical TACE (PPTACE) was associated with a significantly better OS versus those without PPTACE (P < 0.05). Palliative TACE (PTACE) also achieved a significantly better OS compared with those with supportive treatment (ST) only (P < 0.00001). However, TACE had no impact on disease-free survival (P = 0.87) and was less effective than surgical resection (P = 0.003).

The risk factors associated with the development of HCC are chronic Hepatitis B, Hepatitis C, and alcoholic cirrhosis. The standard care for HCC is surgical resection but the scope is limited for some patients. Continuous advancement of radiation therapy enabled the technique of stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) as an option for the treatment of those cases for which surgery cannot be done. According to recent literature and meta-analysis, SBRT is an optimum treatment method with high local control with low toxicity. In SBRT, radiation is delivered with a smaller number of fractions than conventional radiation and employs high-precision delivery and accuracy with the help of image guidance. From a series of retrospective and prospective studies, it has been confirmed that SBRT achieves excellent local control in patients with early-stage inoperable, intermediate-stage, and advanced diseases. BACKGROUND: A 42-year-old male patient related to HBeAg infection and high AFP levels developed HCC BCLC Stage A was admitted to our department. There were two lesions with PTV volumes of 41.07 cc and 9.573 cc with a distance between them of 3.51 cm. These two lesions were treated with a mono-isocentric VMAT planning with SBRT technique. In this case, we present an unusual clinical practice of mono-isocentric treatment planning for treating multiple liver lesions. Since radiation therapy was viewed as the primary form of treatment because the patient wasn't an ideal candidate for surgery, SBRT was selected as the patient's primary modality of treatment because of the tiny volume of the two lesions and the normal liver volume (>700cc). Triple-phase 4DCT was performed for simulation to account for the motion of target volume and normal structures. After delineating the target volume and other normal structures, treatment planning was done with a dose of 45 Gray which was to be delivered in 5 fractions. Two PTVs were created with a margin of 3.0 mm to IGTV. Considering the positions of the lesions, a single isocentre plan was created using a 6MV FFF photon beam for both the PTVs with the VMAT technique. The treatment was carried through with 3 arcs, one coplanar, and the other 2 non-coplanar. At the time of treatment, after the proper positioning of the patient, one CBCT image was taken to match with the planned CT image acquired at the time of the simulation. After applying the translational and rotational errors, the patient was treated. RESULTS: The patient was treated successfully. After treatment, the condition of the patient was normal, and no toxicities have been observed in follow-up. CONCLUSION: Mono isocentric VMAT planning can be used for closely spaced lesions considering the position of lesions and other normal structures in the vicinity.",0.4787123737093013

We report an updated exploratory analysis of OS after 5 years of follow-up, including survival by multiple tumour response measures. METHODS: Participants were randomised to STRIDE (tremelimumab plus durvalumab), durvalumab or sorafenib. OS, depth of response and serious adverse events were assessed. Extended long-term survivors (>/=48 months beyond randomisation) were described. The updated data cut-off was 01 March 2024. RESULTS: Median (95% CI) follow-up durations were 62.49 (59.47-64.79) months (STRIDE) and 59.86 (58.32-61.54) months (sorafenib). The OS hazard ratio (95% CI) for STRIDE vs. sorafenib was 0.76 (0.65-0.89). OS rates at 60 months for STRIDE vs. sorafenib were 19.6% vs. 9.4% overall, 28.7% vs. 12.7% in participants achieving disease control per RECIST v1.1, and 50.7% vs. 26.3% in participants achieving >25% tumour shrinkage. No late-onset treatment-related serious adverse events were reported for STRIDE. There were more extended long-term survivors with STRIDE (83/393, 21.1%) than sorafenib (45/389, 11.6%), and extended long-term survival occurred across all clinically relevant subgroups. CONCLUSIONS: At 5 years, STRIDE sustained an OS benefit vs. sorafenib and maintained a manageable safety profile. OS benefit with STRIDE was improved in participants with disease control. Data suggest that any degree of tumour shrinkage with STRIDE can be associated with improved OS, indicating that conventional response measures may not fully capture the benefits of STRIDE. Nevertheless, participants experiencing deep responses appear to have the greatest benefit. STRIDE continues to set new benchmarks in unresectable HCC with 1 in 5 patients alive at 5 years. CLINICAL TRIAL NUMBER: NCT03298451. IMPACT AND IMPLICATIONS: The phase III HIMALAYA study showed that STRIDE (Single Tremelimumab Regular Interval Durvalumab) improved overall survival (OS) vs. sorafenib in participants with unresectable HCC, including after 4 years of follow-up. Understanding the efficacy and safety of STRIDE over the longer term is important for healthcare providers; here, we demonstrate that STRIDE sustained an OS benefit vs. sorafenib and maintained a manageable safety profile after 5 years of follow-up. OS benefit with STRIDE was improved in participants with disease control and any degree of tumour shrinkage, indicating that conventional response measures may not fully capture the benefits of STRIDE. These findings are important as they set new benchmarks in unresectable HCC and may help guide clinical decisions in the future.",0.4784267581873156

This study aimed to perform a systematic review of the available economic evaluations of TARE for the treatment of HCC. METHODS: The Preferred Reported Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines was followed by applying a search strategy across six databases. All studies identified as economic evaluations with TARE for HCC treatment in English or Spanish language were considered. Costs were adjusted using the 2020 US dollars based on purchasing-power-parity ($US PPP). RESULTS: Among 423 records screened, 20 studies (6 cost-analyses, 3 budget-impact-analyses, 2 cost-effectiveness-analyses, 8 cost-utility-analyses, and 1 cost-minimization analysis) met the pre-defined criteria for inclusion. Thirteen studies were published from the European perspective, six from the United States, and one from the Canadian perspectives. The assessed populations included early- (n = 4), and intermediate-advanced-stages patients (n = 15). Included studies were evaluated from a payer perspective (n = 20) and included both payer and social perspective (n = 2). TARE was compared with transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) in nine studies or sorafenib (n = 11). The life-years gained (LYG) differed by comparator: TARE versus TACE (range: 1.3 to 3.1), and TARE versus sorafenib (range: 1.1 to 2.53). Of the 20 studies, TARE was associated with lower treatment costs in ten studies. The cost of TARE treatment varied widely according to Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) staging system and ranged from 1311 $US PPP/month (BCLC-A) to 71,890 $US PPP/5-years time horizon (BCLC-C). The incremental cost-utility ratio for TARE versus TACE resulted in a 17,397 $US PPP/Quality-adjusted-Life-Years (QALY), and for TARE versus sorafenib ranged from dominant (more effectiveness and lower cost) to 3363 $US PPP/QALY. CONCLUSIONS: Economic evaluations of TARE for HCC treatment are heterogeneous. Overall, TARE is a cost-effective short- and long-term therapy for the treatment of intermediate-advanced HCC.",0.4766696744411083

However, a bibliometric analysis of TARE for HCC is still lacking. This study employed bibliometric methods to analyze the related articles over the past three decades, and aimed to identify trends in clinical research comparing TARE to other treatments. METHODS: Articles related with TARE for HCC were obtained from the Web of Science (WoS). After screening, the R package Bibliometrix was employed to explore the primary bibliometric characteristics. The number of publications was analyzed and mathematically fitted to a curve using Microsoft Excel 2021 and SPSS 25, and then was plotted in the graph using GraphPad Prism 8.0. VOSviewer, SCImago Graphica, and Pajek were utilized for the analysis of researchers' co-authorship, co-occurrence, and visualization. Keywords citation burst was detected by CiteSpace software. RESULTS: A total of 1,110 articles from 1993 to 2023 were included in our final analysis, among which the United States not only ranked the first in term of the number of published articles, also was at the forefront in other important indicators, including the total number of article citations and the average citation frequency. Riad Salem from Northwestern University, also being the organization with the greatest number of research papers, was the most active author and has published 96 papers. The keywords were classified into three clusters: (90)Y microspheres for TARE, Basic research on TARE, and Clinical trial of TARE for HCC. Furthermore, we identified the most frequently cited keywords with strong citation bursts since 2020 were ""multicenter,"" ""overall survival"" and ""PET/CT."" CONCLUSION: Our study employed a bibliometric approach to achieve the visualization research on TARE for HCC, and further revealed the trends and frontiers of TARE research, providing valuable information for researchers to identify the critical and persistent challenges and select potential partners in related area. Based on our analysis, future research focus include the clinical comparative studies on the effect of TARE and TACE combined with immunotherapies or targeted therapy, dosimetry, and personalized TARE therapy for HCC.",0.4750624265439989

Patient-reported outcomes (PROs), a secondary outcome from HIMALAYA, are reported here. METHODS: Participants were randomly assigned to receive STRIDE, durvalumab, or sorafenib. PROs were assessed (preplanned secondary outcome) using the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer 30-item Quality of Life Questionnaire and the 18-item HCC module. Time to deterioration (TTD), change from baseline and improvement rate in global health status/quality of life (GHS/QoL), functioning, and disease-related symptoms were analyzed. RESULTS: In total, 1,171 participants were randomly assigned to STRIDE (n = 393), durvalumab (n = 389), or sorafenib (n = 389) and were evaluable for PRO assessments. Across treatment arms, compliance rates for PROs were >77% at baseline and >70% overall. Baseline scores were comparable across treatment arms. TTD in GHS/QoL, physical functioning, fatigue, appetite loss, and abdominal pain was numerically longer for both STRIDE and durvalumab versus sorafenib. Clinically meaningful deterioration in PROs was not observed in any treatment arm. However, TTD in nausea and abdominal swelling was numerically longer for STRIDE versus sorafenib, and the likelihood of clinically meaningful improvement in GHS/QoL, role, emotional and social functioning, and disease-related symptoms was greater with STRIDE and durvalumab versus sorafenib. PROs with STRIDE and durvalumab were generally similar. CONCLUSION: Compared with sorafenib, STRIDE and durvalumab were associated with clinically meaningful, patient-centered GHS/QoL, functioning, and symptom benefits in people with uHCC. These findings support the benefits of the STRIDE regimen compared with sorafenib for a diverse population reflective of the global uHCC population.",0.4701320800299855

However, the surgical technique needs to be improved. The present study aimed to evaluate the ""no-touch"" technique in LT. METHODS: From January 2018 to December 2019, we performed a prospective randomized controlled trial on HCC patients who underwent LT. The patients were randomized into two groups: a no-touch technique LT group (NT group, n = 38) and a conventional LT technique group (CT group, n = 46). Operative outcomes and survival in the two groups were analyzed. RESULTS: The perioperative parameters were comparable between the two groups (P > 0.05). There was no significant difference between the two groups in disease-free survival (DFS) (P = 0.732) or overall survival (OS) (P = 0.891). Of 36 patients who were beyond the Hangzhou criteria for LT, the DFS of the patients in the NT group was significantly longer than that in the CT group (median 402 vs. 126 days, P = 0.025). In 31 patients who had portal vein tumor thrombosis (PVTT), DFS and OS in the NT group were significantly better than those in the CT group (median DFS 420 vs. 167 days, P = 0.022; 2-year OS rate 93.8% vs. 66.7%, P = 0.043). In 14 patients who had diffuse-type HCCs, DFS and OS were significantly better in the NT group than those in the CT group (median DFS 141 vs. 56 days, P = 0.008; 2-year OS rate 75.0% vs. 33.3%, P = 0.034).

However, no head-to-head trials have compared the efficacy outcomes between these two combination regimens. Therefore, an unanchored matching-adjusted indirect comparison (MAIC) was conducted to evaluate the comparative efficacy of tislelizumab plus lenvatinib versus sintilimab plus bevacizumab biosimilar. METHODS: Individual patients from the BGB-A317-211 study (NCT04401800) for tislelizumab plus lenvatinib were adjusted to match the population from the ORIENT-32 (NCT03794440) for sintilimab plus bevacizumab biosimilar through an unanchored MAIC. Odds Ratios (ORs) of objective response rates (ORR) and disease control rates (DCR), and hazard ratios (HRs) of progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) were evaluated to quantify the relative treatment effect between the two treatment regimens after population matching. Sensitivity analyses were performed by sequentially removing one variable in the matching and adjusting the population through simulated treatment comparison (STC). RESULTS: After matching, baseline characteristics were balanced between the tislelizumab plus lenvatinib group (effective sample size [ESS] = 49, ESS/N = 79.03%) and sintilimab plus bevacizumab biosimilar group (N = 380). MAIC analysis indicated that tislelizumab plus lenvatinib group showed significantly higher ORR per RECIST v1.1 (OR = 2.56, 95% CI 1.40-4.63; p = 0.0027), higher DCR (OR = 3.81, 95% CI 1.62-11.20; p = 0.0013), longer PFS (HR = 0.56, 95% CI 0.37-0.84, p = 0.0054), and improved OS (HR = 0.43, 95% CI 0.25-0.74, p = 0.0023), compared to sintilimab plus bevacizumab biosimilar group. Sensitivity analysis by two different methods supported the findings from the primary MAIC analysis.

Results reported herein are from a 4-year updated OS analysis of HIMALAYA. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Participants with uHCC and no previous systemic treatment were randomized to STRIDE (n = 393), durvalumab (n = 389), or sorafenib (n = 389). The updated data cut-off was 23 January 2023. OS and serious adverse events (AEs) were assessed. Additionally, baseline characteristics and subsequent therapies were analyzed in long-term survivors (>/=36 months beyond randomization). RESULTS: For STRIDE, durvalumab, and sorafenib, median [95% confidence interval (CI)] follow-up was 49.12 months (46.95-50.17 months), 48.46 months (46.82-49.81 months), and 47.31 months (45.08-49.15 months), respectively. OS hazard ratio (95% CI) for STRIDE versus sorafenib was 0.78 (0.67-0.92). The 36-month OS rate for STRIDE was 30.7% versus 19.8% for sorafenib. The 48-month OS rate remained higher for STRIDE at 25.2%, versus 15.1% for sorafenib. The long-term OS benefit of STRIDE was observed across clinically relevant subgroups and was further improved in participants who achieved disease control. Long-term survivors with STRIDE (n = 103) included participants across clinically relevant subgroups, and 57.3% (59/103) had no reported subsequent anticancer therapy. No new serious treatment-related AEs occurred with STRIDE from the primary analysis (17.5%; 68/388). Durvalumab maintained OS noninferiority to sorafenib and no late-onset safety signals were identified. CONCLUSIONS: These data represent the longest follow-up to date in phase III studies in uHCC. The unprecedented 3- and 4-year OS rates reinforce the sustained long-term OS benefit of STRIDE versus sorafenib. STRIDE maintained a tolerable yet differentiated safety profile from other current uHCC therapies.

We assessed whether entecavir (ETV) plus Biejia-Ruangan compound (BRC), an anti-fibrotic traditional Chinese medicine, can further reduce the risk of HCC in treatment-naive Chinese patients with CHB and an Ishak fibrosis score of >/=3 points derived from our parent double-blind randomized placebo-controlled trial. METHODS: After a 72-week comparison between ETV+BRC and ETV+placebo treatment, participants were eligible to enter an open-label treatment phase and were followed up every 6 months. The primary [secondary] endpoints were the incidence of HCC [liver-related deaths, non-HCC events, and non-liver-related deaths]. Modified intention-to-treat (mITT), intention-to-treat (ITT), and per-protocol (PP) populations were defined for the time-to-event analysis. RESULTS: A total of 1,000 patients were recruited; the median age was 42.0 years; 69.9% were male and 58.3% were HBeAg positive. In the mITT population, the 7-year cumulative incidence of HCC [liver-related deaths] was 4.7% [0.2%] for ETV+BRC, which was significantly lower than 9.3% [2.2%] for ETV monotherapy (p = 0.008 [p = 0.030]). Notably, ETV+BRC treatment yielded a lower incidence of HCC in those who did not achieve regression of fibrosis at week 72 than ETV monotherapy (p = 0.018). There were no differences in the other 2 secondary endpoints or safety profiles between the groups. Multivariable Cox proportional regression analysis, including the treatment allocation as a parameter, also demonstrated that ETV+BRC treatment was associated with a reduced incidence of HCC. The ITT and PP analyses showed consistent results. CONCLUSIONS: ETV plus BRC combination treatment could further reduce the risk of HCC and liver-related deaths in patients with CHB and advanced fibrosis or cirrhosis, which may have important clinical implications for HCC prevention. LAY SUMMARY: Patients with chronic hepatitis B virus infection are at an increased risk of developing liver cancer (specifically hepatocellular carcinoma [HCC]). While there are effective antiviral treatments that can suppress the virus in chronically infected patients, the risk of HCC remains. Herein, we show that adding a traditional Chinese medicine called Biejia-Ruangan compound to an antiviral reduced the risk of HCC in patients with chronic hepatitis B.",0.4605805710335631

MATERIALS AND METHODS: A systematic search of the Embase and MEDLINE databases was conducted using keywords and Medical Subject Headings terms related to TARE and hepatic metastases from PDAC. Observational studies and clinical trials reporting overall survival (OS), hepatic progression-free survival (hPFS), or tumor response after TARE were included. RESULTS: Eight studies, comprising 145 patients with metastatic PDAC, met the inclusion criteria. No randomized controlled trials were identified, and 4 studies were prospective. Forty-four (30.3%) patients underwent previous pancreatic resection, and 66 (45.5%) had extrahepatic metastases at the time of TARE. Most studies (n = 6) used resin microspheres for TARE. The pooled disease control rate was 69.4% at a median of 3 months. The median OS from the time of TARE ranged from 3.7 to 9 months. The median hPFS ranged from 2.4 to 5.2 months. There were 31 Grade 3-4 biochemical toxicities and 4 treatment-related deaths. CONCLUSIONS: The role of TARE in patients with hepatic metastases from PDAC remains unclear owing to low patient numbers, limited prospective data, and heterogeneity in the study design. Further prospective studies are required to evaluate the role of TARE in carefully selected patients with liver-only metastatic disease.",0.456035008906698

HCC presents a daunting clinical landscape characterized by nonspecific early symptoms and late-stage detection, contributing to its poor prognosis. Moreover, the limited efficacy of existing treatments and high recurrence rates post-surgery compound the challenges in managing this disease. While histopathologic examination remains the cornerstone for HCC diagnosis, its utility in guiding preoperative decisions is constrained. Radiomics, an emerging field, harnesses high-throughput imaging data, encompassing shape, texture, and intensity features, alongside clinical parameters, to elucidate disease characteristics through advanced computational techniques such as machine learning and statistical modeling. MRI radiomics specifically holds significant importance in the diagnosis and treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). OBJECTIVE: This study aims to evaluate the methodology of radiomics and delineate the clinical advancements facilitated by MRI-based radiomics in the realm of hepatocellular carcinoma diagnosis and treatment. METHODS: A systematic review of the literature was conducted, encompassing peer-reviewed articles published between July 2018 and Jan 2025, sourced from PubMed and Google Scholar. Key search terms included Hepatocellular carcinoma, HCC, Liver cancer, Magnetic resonance imaging, MRI, radiomics, deep learning, machine learning, and artificial intelligence. RESULTS: A comprehensive analysis of 93 articles underscores the efficacy of MRI radiomics, a noninvasive imaging analysis modality, across various facets of HCC management. These encompass tumor differentiation, subtype classification, histopathological grading, prediction of microvascular invasion (MVI), assessment of treatment response, early recurrence prognostication, and metastasis prediction. CONCLUSION: MRI radiomics emerges as a promising adjunctive tool for early HCC detection and personalized preoperative decision-making, with the overarching goal of optimizing patient outcomes. Nevertheless, the current lack of interpretability within the field underscores the imperative for continued research and validation efforts.",0.45519250218730645

The lack of effective predicting biomarkers not only leads to delayed detection of the disease but also results in ineffective immunotherapy and limited clinical survival benefit. METHODS: We exploited the single-cell approach (cytometry by time of flight (CyTOF)) to analyze peripheral blood mononuclear cells from multicohorts of human samples. Immune signatures for different stages of patients with HCC were systematically profiled and statistically compared. Furthermore, the dynamic changes of peripheral immune compositions for both first-line and second-line patients with HCC after anti-PD-1 monotherapy were also evaluated and systematically compared. RESULTS: We identified stage-specific immune signatures for HCC and constructed a logistic AdaBoost-SVM classifier based on these signatures. The classifier provided superior performance in predicting early-stage HCC over the commonly used serum alpha-fetoprotein level. We also revealed the treatment stage-specific immune signatures from peripheral blood and their dynamical changing patterns, all of which were integrated to achieve early discrimination of patients with non-durable benefit for both first-line and second-line anti-PD-1 monotherapies. CONCLUSIONS: Our newly identified single-cell peripheral immune signatures provide promising non-invasive biomarkers for early detection of HCC and early assessment for anti-PD-1 immunotherapy efficacy in patients with advanced HCC. These new findings can potentially facilitate early diagnosis and novel immunotherapy for patients with HCC in future practice and further guide the utility of CyTOF in clinical translation of cancer research.

In this systematic review with pooled analysis, we aimed to assess safety and efficacy of ICI therapy following LT. METHODS: We performed a systematic search of case reports and series published until January 2022. We included 31 publications reporting a total of 52 patients treated with ICIs after LT and assessed in a pooled analysis the risk of graft rejection and the outcome of ICI therapy. RESULTS: Acute graft rejection occurred in 15 patients (28.8%) and 7 patients (13.4% of the total cohort) died because of graft loss. Rejection was associated with shorter overall survival (OS) (17.2 months, confidence interval [CI] 12.1-22.2 vs. 3.5 months, CI 1.6-5.4, p < 0.001). Disease control rate was 44.2% (n = 23), and in these patients, OS was longer than in non-responders (26.4 months, CI 20.8-32.0 vs. 3.4 months, CI 2.1-4.7, p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Observational, off-label experience suggests that treatment with ICI for advanced malignancies in LT recipients might not be discarded a priori. This notwithstanding, ICI treatment in these patients is associated with a substantial risk of graft rejection and mortality. Prospective studies are needed to provide adequate safety and efficacy figures of ICI treatment in this fragile population.",0.42402431830336496

The goal of this study is to compare the analgesic effect among celecoxib, parecoxib, and oxycodone in patients undergoing TACE. METHODS: This prospective study was a randomized, paralleled trial in which 213 patients were enrolled. Patients were assigned at the ratio of 1:1:1 to receive celecoxib, parecoxib, or controlled-release oxycodone 1 hour before TACE (T0) and once every 12 hours for 2 days after TACE. Pain scores, pain intensity, and adverse events in each time interval were evaluated and compared among the 3 groups. RESULTS: The mean pain score 12 hours after T0 in the parecoxib group (2.8) was lower than that in the celecoxib (4.4; P = .001) and oxycodone groups (4.2; P = .005). The number of patients suffering severe pain was 10 (14.7%) in the parecoxib, 25 (36.8%) in the celecoxib, and 23 (32.9%) in the oxycodone groups (P = .009). Twelve hours after T0, the incidence of grade 3 vomiting in the parecoxib group (2.9%) was significantly lower than that in the oxycodone group (17.1%; P = .006). In the multivariate analysis, nonparecoxib prophylactic analgesia (odds ratio [OR], 4.620; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.877-11.370; P = .001) as well as embolization of the gallbladder (OR, 8.666; 95% CI, 2.402-31.262; P = .001) and normal liver parenchyma (OR, 3.278; 95% CI, 1.409-7.627; P = .006) were the independent factors of severe pain intensity 12 hours after T0. CONCLUSION: Parecoxib is superior to oxycodone and celecoxib for pain control with fewer adverse events.

Oncologists are challenged with evidence-based selection of treatments, and response is evaluated retrospectively based on serial imaging beginning after 2-3 months. As a result, cumulative toxicities may appear in patients who will not benefit. Early recognition of non-benefit would reduce cumulative toxicities. Our objective was to determine treatment-related changes in the circulating metabolome corresponding to treatment futility. METHODS: Metabolomic studies were performed on serial plasma samples from patients with CRC in a randomized controlled trial of cetuximab vs. cetuximab + brivanib (N = 188). GC-MS quantified named 94 metabolites and concentrations were evaluated at baseline, Weeks 1, 4 and 12 after treatment initiation. In a discovery cohort (N = 68), a model distinguishing changes in metabolites associated with radiographic disease progression and response was generated using OPLS-DA. A cohort of 120 patients was used for validation of the model. RESULTS: By one week after treatment, a stable model of 21 metabolites could distinguish between progression and partial response (R2Y = 0.859; Q2Y = 0.605; P = 5e-4). In the validation cohort, patients with the biomarker had a significantly shorter OS (P < 0.0001). In a separate cohort of patients with HCC on axitinib, appearance of the biomarker also signified a shorter PFS (1.7 months vs. 9.2 months, P = 0.001). CONCLUSION: We have identified changes in the metabolome that appear within 1 week of starting treatment associated with treatment futility. The novel approach described is applicable to future efforts in developing a biomarker for early assessment of treatment efficacy.",0.3919535314871042

METHOD: A systematic search of randomized controlled trials reporting the efficacy of various adjuvant chemotherapy methods in patients with colorectal cancer who underwent curative surgery was conducted. The primary outcome was the LM rate. RESULTS: This network meta-analysis included 19 studies reporting on 12,588 participants, comparing portal vein infusion chemotherapy (PVIC) versus hepatic arterial infusion chemotherapy (HAIC) versus systematic chemotherapy (SC) versus surgery alone. The HAIC group had the lowest LM rate when compared to the other three groups (odds ratio [OR] of PVIC vs. HAIC: 1.86; OR of SC vs. HAIC: 1.98; and HAIC vs. surgery alone: 0.43). The LM rate did not differ significantly between PVIC, SC, and surgery alone. The recurrence rates were lower for PVIC and HAIC than for surgery alone (the ORs for PVIC and HAIC were 0.73 [95% CI: 0.58-0.92] and 0.45 [95% CI: 0.26-0.77]). The mortality rates of patients undergoing PVIC and HAIC were lower than that of patients undergoing surgery alone (the ORs for PVIC and HAIC were 0.77 [95% CI: 0.64-0.93] and 0.49 [95% CI: 0.24-0.98]).

Currently, no universal treatment effectively addresses all three conditions. The Traditional Chinese Medicine formula Xiao-Chai-Hu decoction (XCHD) has shown promise in treating hepatitis, inhibiting LF, and serving as an adjunct therapy for HCC. This study evaluates the efficacy and optimal treatment durations of XCHD in managing these liver diseases using meta-analysis and machine learning techniques. METHODS: Registered in the PROSPERO database (CRD42024534445), this meta-analysis systematically searched seven databases, including 54 studies with a total of 5,710 patients. Statistical analysis was performed using Stata 17.0. Five machine learning models-Random Forest (RF), XGBoost, Lasso, Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), and a stacking model combining these algorithms-were employed to analyze the data and predict the time-effect relationships. The optimal durations of XCHD treatment for the liver disease trilogy were subsequently projected. RESULTS: XCHD significantly improved the primary outcome indicators for hepatitis, liver fibrosis, and HCC. Additionally, XCHD demonstrated a beneficial effect on liver dysfunction caused by these diseases. Machine learning predicted the optimal treatment durations of XCHD as 12 weeks for hepatitis, 20.31 weeks for liver fibrosis, and 12 weeks for HCC. CONCLUSION: XCHD is effective in treating the liver disease trilogy, with optimal treatment durations of 12 weeks for hepatitis and HCC, and 20.31 weeks for liver fibrosis. These findings support the potential of XCHD in developing precise clinical strategies for managing liver diseases. This study innovatively integrates meta-analysis with machine learning to determine the optimal treatment durations, providing a novel approach for evidence-based precision medicine in Traditional Chinese Medicine.",0.3887482394530658

Since ablative zone tissue changes over time, it becomes challenging to determine therapy effectiveness over an extended period. Thus, an immediate post-procedural evaluation of the ablation zone is crucial, as it could influence the need for a second-look treatment or follow-up plan. Assessing treatment response immediately after ablation is essential to attain favorable outcomes. This study examines the efficacy of image fusion strategies immediately post-ablation in liver neoplasms to determine therapeutic response. METHODOLOGY: A comprehensive systematic search using PRISMA methodology was conducted using EMBASE, MEDLINE (via PUBMED), and Cochrane Library Central Registry electronic databases to identify articles that assessed the immediate post-ablation response in malignant hepatic tumors with fusion imaging (FI) systems. The data were retrieved on relevant clinical characteristics, including population demographics, pre-intervention clinical history, lesion characteristics, and intervention type. For the outcome metrics, variables such as average fusion time, intervention metrics, technical success rate, ablative safety margin, supplementary ablation rate, technical efficacy rate, LTP rates, and reported complications were extracted. RESULTS: Twenty-two studies were included for review after fulfilling the study eligibility criteria. FI's immediate technical success rate ranged from 81.3% to 100% in 17/22 studies. In 16/22 studies, the ablative safety margin was assessed immediately after ablation. Supplementary ablation was performed in 9 studies following immediate evaluation by FI. In 15/22 studies, the technical effectiveness rates during the first follow-up varied from 89.3% to 100%. CONCLUSION: Based on the studies included, we found that FI can accurately determine the immediate therapeutic response in liver cancer ablation image fusion and could be a feasible intraprocedural tool for determining short-term post-ablation outcomes in unresectable liver neoplasms. There are some technical challenges that limit the widespread adoption of FI techniques. Large-scale randomized trials are warranted to improve on existing protocols. Future research should emphasize improving FI's technological capabilities and clinical applicability to a broader range of tumor types and ablation procedures.",0.36489196667987855

The recommended non-invasive methods for determining the indication for liver transplantation are the Model for End-stage Liver Disease score, and the alpha-foetoprotein score in case of hepatocellular carcinoma. Radiological methods are the cornerstones for the diagnosis of vascular and biliary complications after liver transplantation. The possible diseases of the liver graft after transplantation are multiple and often intertwined. Non-invasive diagnostic methods have been poorly evaluated in this context, apart from the recurrence of hepatitis C. Liver biopsy remains the gold standard for evaluating graft lesions in the majority of cases, especially graft rejection.",0.33676021373303056

Immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) therapy is indicated for many of these; however, the risks and benefits of ICI use in the SOTR population have not been well characterized. We performed a systematic literature review identifying 119 reported cases of ICI use among SOTRs. Treatments used included PD-1 inhibition (75.6%), CTLA-4 inhibition (12.6%), PD-L1 inhibition (1.7%), and combination and/or sequential ICI therapy (10.1%). The most common cancers included cutaneous melanoma (35.3%), hepatocellular carcinoma (22.7%), and cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (18.5%). The overall objective response rate (ORR) was 34.5%, with a median duration of response of 8.0 months. Ongoing response was seen in 21.0%. Cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma had significantly better ORR compared with other cancer types (68.2% vs 26.8%; odds ratio [OR], 5.85; P =.0006). Factors associated with improved ORR included increasing time from transplant to ICI (OR, 1.09; P =.008) and preemptive reduction in intensity of the graft maintenance immunosuppressive regimen (50.0% vs 18.5%; OR, 4.40; P =.0088). Rejection occurred in 41.2%, graft failure in 23.5%, and immune-related adverse events in 18.5%. Factors significantly associated with allograft rejection included allograft PD-L1 positivity (100% vs 0%; P<.0001) and absence of tacrolimus in the immunosuppressive regimen (48.7% vs 25.6%; OR, 0.36; P =.019). The most common cause of death was progressive malignancy (64.0%), followed by graft failure (24.0%). Our analysis provides current benchmark data to help inform management of SOTRs with advanced cancers that are reflected by our patient cohort. Biomarker development, more robust datasets, and prospective study of concomitant immunosuppression management may help refine decision-making in this complex scenario in the future. Close coordination of care between the medical oncologist and transplant specialist is encouraged to help optimize treatment outcomes.",0.3311124132125962
The utility of P-I-R classification in predicting the on-treatment histological and clinical outcomes of patients with hepatitis B and advanced liver fibrosis.,2024,Hepatology,?,10.1097/HEP.0000000000000563,"The utility of P-I-R classification in predicting the on-treatment histological and clinical outcomes of patients with hepatitis B and advanced liver fibrosis.

However, the prognostic implication of P-I-R classification is not elucidated. Therefore, in the present research, we investigated the utility of P-I-R classification in predicting the on-treatment clinical outcomes. APPROACH AND RESULTS: In an extension study on a randomized controlled trial, we originally enrolled 1000 patients with chronic hepatitis B and biopsy-proven histological significant fibrosis, and treated them for more than 7 years with entecavir-based therapy. Among the 727 patients with a second biopsy at treatment week 72, we compared P-I-R classification and Ishak score changes in 646 patients with adequate liver sections for the histological evaluation. Progressive, indeterminate, and regressive cases were observed in 70%, 17%, and 13% of patients before treatments and 20%, 14%, and 64% after 72-week treatment, respectively, which could further differentiate the histological outcomes of patients with stable Ishak scores. The 7-year cumulative incidence of HCC was 1.5% for the regressive cases, 4.3% for the indeterminate cases, and 22.8% for the progressive cases ( p <0.001). After adjusting for age, treatment regimen, platelet counts, cirrhosis, Ishak fibrosis score changes, and Laennec staging, the posttreatment progressive had a HR of 17.77 (vs. posttreatment regressive; 95% CI: 5.55-56.88) for the incidence of liver-related events (decompensation, HCC, and death/liver transplantation). CONCLUSIONS: The P-I-R classification can be a meaningful complement to the Ishak fibrosis score not only in evaluating the histological changes but also in predicting the clinical outcomes.",0.32886539181009455

OBJECTIVES: The objective of this systematic review was to identify evidence based intraoperative transfusion and coagulation management strategies that improve immediate and short-term outcomes after LT. METHODS: PRISMA-guidelines and GRADE-approach were followed. Three subquestions were formulated. (Q); Q1: transfusion management; Q2: antifibrinolytic therapy; and Q3: coagulation monitoring. RESULTS: Sixteen studies were included for Q1, six for Q2, and 10 for Q3. Q1: PRBC and platelet transfusions were associated with higher mortality. The use of prothrombin complex concentrate (PCC) and fibrinogen concentrate (FC) were not associated with reductions in intraoperative transfusion or increased thrombotic events. The use of cell salvage was not associated with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) recurrence or mortality. Cell salvage and transfusion education significantly decreased blood product transfusions. Q2: Epsilon-aminocaproic acid (EACA) and tranexamic acid (TXA) were not associated with decreased blood product transfusion, improvements in patient or graft survival, or increases in thrombotic events. Q3: Viscoelastic testing (VET) was associated with decreased allogeneic blood product transfusion compared to conventional coagulation tests (CCT) and is likely to be cost-effective. Coagulation management guided by VET may be associated with increases in FC and PCC use. CONCLUSION: Q1: A specific blood product transfusion practice is not recommended (QOE; low | Recommendation; weak). Cell salvage and educational interventions are recommended (QOE: low | Grade of Recommendation: moderate). Q2: The routine use of antifibrinolytics is not recommended (QOE; low | Recommendation; weak). Q3: The use of VET is recommended (QOE; low-moderate | Recommendation; strong).",0.3238199555608553

METHODS: We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of observational studies published until Dec 31, 2021, that investigated the long-term outcome of LT in hepatic GSD patients. A literature search in the MEDLINE/PubMed, EMBASE,Cochrane Library, Scopus and Web of Science Core Collection databases was performed. RESULTS: 14 studies with 210 patients were included in our analysis. As the results showed, the pooled proportion of GSD patients with complications after liver transplant (e.g., hemorrhagic shock, biliary complications, tacrolimus encephalopathy, chronic hepatitis, hepatic artery thrombosis, hepatic adenoma, sepsis, liver dysfunction, chronic rejection, acute cellular rejection, and CMV infection) was 27.7% (95% CI: 20.42-35.67) without heterogeneity (I(2)  = 24.04%), as calculated by the random-effect model. The pooled proportion of GSD patients with complications related to GSD after LT, including HCC (Hepatocellular carcinoma), renal complication, muscle problems, delayed menarche, persistent neutropenia, pneumonitis, renal failure, and hepatic adenoma was 22.2% (95% CI: 7.97-40.01) with high heterogeneity (I(2)  = 82.47%). Subgroup analysis including the age of patients (adult/pediatric), duration of follow-up, and type of donor was conducted to investigate the resources of heterogeneity. CONCLUSION: According to our investigation and review analysis, most GSD patients showed significant outcome improvement after liver transplantation. Overall, our findings showed an excellent outcome of liver transplantation in GSD patients; however, it needs further investigations to be confirmed.",0.2575477223197308
